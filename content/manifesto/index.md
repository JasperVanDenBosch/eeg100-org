# #EEG100 Manifesto

## Toward a deontological framework for EEG science

We are working on a manifesto - it is intended as a starting point 
for developing a deontological framework for EEG science and 
as a collective commitment to pursuing ethical and responsible scientific practices 
within our field. 
We plan to detail views on key topics including scientific integrity, 
research responsibilities, and the social and environmental impacts of our work. 
Our main aim is to encourage critical reflection on the potential implications 
of our research and in doing so, advance the field for the greater good of humanity.
