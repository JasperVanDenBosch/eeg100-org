# #EEG100
## 100 years of EEG (1924-2024)

In July 2024 it will be exactly 100 years since [the first human EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography#History) was recorded.
Much has happened since then and in light of ongoing developments on hardware, software, and theory side the method might still be about to grow to its full potential.

People in various scientific organisations are working to celebrate this jubilee throughout the year.
This site lists events, articles, and other relevant resources related to the anniversary - if you know of something you believe is missing on this page, please get in touch!
