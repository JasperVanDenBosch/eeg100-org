But I consider it a major advantage of EEG that it is a very low-risk technology, for instance as compared with fMRI (not terribly high-risk either, but still it involves a strong magnetic field) or MEG (involves liquid helium).\tI am not sure there are any currently. I might consider dry/mobile EEG, but IMO the major drawback at the moment is that the synchronization with other mobile datastreams (eye tracking, movement, ambient sound, environmental events) is still in its infancy.\tAgain, reliable synchronization of mobile EEG with other mobile datastreams (eye tracking, movement, ambient sound, environmental events).\tI am a skeptic here; I think EEG is a largely mature technology that will not see a lot of further substantial development. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly &quot;reading&quot; in the sense of very broad states or content categories, not as a movie of your dreams\t\ti believe it is already used for that purpose, but its validity isn&#x27;t great.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot sure\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsocial neuroscience\t\t\tICA and other source separation methods Active electrodes/signal amplification techniques Mobile EEG and EEG in specialized contexts (e.g., MRI magnets) Source localization Synchronization of EEG signal with other biomarkers and behavioral indicators\t\tLack of precision of results; noisiness of results\tMeta-tagging standards and dataset sharing / compilation Open science practices Automation of data processing steps; machine learning approaches to data processing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuture is in novel developments and appoaches focused on oscillations and aperiodic brain activity, coherence and connectivy and RSA, machine learning approaches\t\texpertize and more more complicated methods that needs to be teached and analyzed, missing of good tutorials help in applying complex analyses\t\tmot machine learning exploratory data-driven approaches\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHIgh density EEG Improved A/D conversion Active electrodes Source localization  I think EEG became a mainstream neuroscience method when people started to consider it a form of neuroimaging, on par with fMRI but with different strengths/weaknesses.

Despite the technological limitations of being a non-invasive recording technique, EEG is suitable for spatial analysis and localization, temporal analysis providing a millisecond time resolution, and it can be also used for online- and realtime monitoring of brain activity.   \tMonitoring in ICU&#x27;s and Anesthesia \tEEG is a low-risk technology for the subjects and patients.   The challenges are the technological limitations (impedance noise, amplifier noise)  and the influence of artifacts.   In order to obtain good recording quality, low impedance (wet) electrodes need to be used, and it takes some effort to mount them properly. This seems to be one of the main limitations of EEG, and prevents wider usage of EEG technology. \tIf you want a hype like chatgpt, provide to every compotuer a simple (e.g. 2. channel) eeg acquisition system, tell users that there is some advantage for them to use it (either gaming, feel-good, healthy, sports, geneology, or any other bullshit) and collect EEG data from millions of users, and sell the data to adversment industry, law enforcment, and other dubios interest groups.

However there are important adversaries - the pharmaceutilcal industry. \t\tNo, I do not see any technology, that could replace EEG.  Alternatives (e.g. fMRI, Nirs, etc) measure are only secondar metrics (measure the metabolism) and can not really replace EEG.  Also in sleep analysis, a simple ECG and respiratory and movment sensors can not really replace EEG as a metric for the activity of the brain. \t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarketing and advertisiing do alreay manipulate emotions, cognitive states and decission making - this happens with or w/o EEG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNew techniques to facilitate the easy recording of simple EEG parameters (such as screening for non-convulsive status epilepticus) by non-experts  Increasing use of machine learning to analyse the large amount of data acquiring in a clinical setting\t\tStaffing challenges in terms of expertise in applying EEG electrodes if not using one of the newer simpler systems\tHeadsets enabling easy application\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseizure diagnosis evoked response source localization \t\ttoo much information in EEG\tAIs\tAIs could handle all the mundane works in EEG analysis\tmerge into the common platform with cellular neurophysiology\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeg\tSleep staging and epilepsy diagnostic assessment \t\tlack of user/researcher competency, lack of training in proper usage\topen science techniques, machine learning, computational modeling\tautomatization and standardization of data processing; intuitive visualization and digital publication of research methods and findings. \tremote sensing techniques, multimodal imaging, addressing the inverse problem all would allow in-vivo neurophysiology. \toptical pump MEG systems may replace EEG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTracking the &#x27;brain at work&#x27; non-invasively with an exquisite temporal resolution.

As EEG technology progresses, new clinical applications are beginning to open up. Soon we will have clinical diagnostics for developmental and cognitive dysfunctions that can be used to evaluate and guide treatment options. In addition, brain computer interfaces have the potential to restore freedom and mobility to people with disabilities.\t\tThe door between human neuroscience research and the clinical world is very small. Getting clinical data out to researchers and getting new techniques and software into the clinic is very challenging. Ethics and regulatory issues are a big part of this, but other issues include incentives. For example, the incentive of the clinician is to diagnose and treat individual patients and bill for those activities; not to curate data and manage records for research purposes. Similarly the incentives for academic researchers is to get short-term grants quickly and low hanging fruit publications; both of which are easier to accomplish if the researcher has full control over the data.\tAs of today, advance computer programming is a unique and powerful skill that is rare in neurosciences and practically non-existent in the clinical world. Tools that help programming-illiterate individuals to code will open up opportunities, especially within hospitals. This will help integrate advanced analyzes into clinical care which will provide the evidence needed for new billing codes. This will have a huge impact on the clinical value of EEG.\tAs EEG technology progresses, new clinical applications are beginning to open up.

In addition, brain computer interfaces have the potential to restore freedom and mobility to people with disabilities.\tIn the distant future, there is a possibility that EEG technology is a benefit to healthy individuals as well as patients. Methods for humans to interface with devices could allow improvements in communication with other humans as well as machines and databases. But I&#x27;ll probably be dead before then.\tIn the future, pure visual assessment of standard density EEG will no longer be necessary.

The sweep VEP technique for measuring infant visual acuity in developmental disorders 7. Improved source localization through combination with MRI\t\tThe biggest barrier is the failure to make a concerted effort to provide detailed source localization of the scalp signals. A key requirement is an accurate model of the impedences of the various tissues in the path from the cortex to the scalp and the full 3D spatial layout of these tissues. A 3-spherical-shell model is totally inadequate for this purpose.  What is needed is extensive local intracortical stimulation and recording experiments to pin down the precise parameters of all tissues through a detailed forward model framework. Current approaches such as minimum norm inverse models are totally inadequate for this purpose.\t1. The above comments lay out a strategy that could improve source localization by an order of magnitude, which would markedly increase the utility of EEG. 2. This should be done in conjunction with combined EEG/MEG measures giving the complete 3-vector information for full source localization. 3. Whole-head dry electrodes combined with machine learning analysis has the promise of identifying meaningful patterns relative to the varieties of cognitive function. The key here is to have a detailed scoring of the sequence of events in complex stimuli such as movies. 4. The resonant structure of early visual processing reflecting a variety of microcircuits remains almost totally unexplored, but could lead to major advances in the neruoscientific understanding of the human brain.\tAs in the previous box.  \tFuturist Ray Kurzweil envisaged the technology of swarms of injectable nanobots inhabiting the capillaries within organs such as the brain, vastly increasing the localized readout and stimulation control the neural, or other organismic, systems.

I have worked in industry (specifically, defence), and people believe that EEG is &quot;plug and play&quot;. I had people asking me why I couldn&#x27;t just put a cap on a fighter pilot and find out when they&#x27;re going to make an error... They were sorely disappointed when they realised the reality of what is truly possible to obtain from EEG.\tI would think machine learning methods of decoding behaviour from brain signals\tBCI is the clear application. I think there is a lot of potential for BCIs in medical disorders such as stroke, etc. Commercially, I&#x27;m not sure the field can move at a pace that is acceptable for consumer application.\tI honestly expect the current technique to be obsolete by then unless there are more targeted findings surrounding the functional relevance of brain signals recorded using EEG\tI see functional imaging techniques becoming more accessible, cheaper and streamlined for use in cognitive neuroscience research, particularly in the field of neurodegeneration\tI believe that some of these have been realised, but not well.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tERP techniques, especially for neurology Understanding of sleep EEG EEG coherence and connectivity analysis\t\tHigh noise in the signal High risk of false positive results Main barrier today - absense of centralized large-scale open datasets\tStandardization of data preprocessing and analysis accompanied by the establishing of large scale (&amp;gt;100000 recordings) databases\tFurther (slow) development of EEG for estimating people&#x27;s functional state in real world (e.g., for analyzing performance quality) Development of reliable EEG biomarker of psychiatric and neurological diseases\t\tWith further development and minituarization in fMRI EEG might become redundant for cognition research\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe use of computers to be able to summarize and transform the data in many ways. This allowed researchers to extract information from the EEG that would otherwise remain invisible.  The development of BCI and mobile EEG together are creating a new way of interaction and communication with the world transcending existing physical limitations. \t\tIn research, the biggest risk I perceive of using EEG is that it offers a virtually limitless well of information. There can be a sort of hypnotic effect of this on researchers, who feel everything needs to be linked to some feature of the EEG. This does not necessarily advance our knowledge, but is very effective in spending funds.  In cognitive neuroscience I also see a lot of people testing whether this or that component is &quot;altered&quot; in some disorder. In clinical practice, where time-pressure is a real thing, and the mental model of psychological difficulties is often biased towards &quot;disorders&quot;, I see a risk of doing a quick EEG will replace a good conversation that might be much more helpful for the patient.  In commercial applications and their marketing, the limitations of EEG are often glossed over and unrealistic promises are made. Here I see the risk of personal EEG devices being sold, then people understand eventually its all BS and EEG will be discredited in general.\tIn first instance, I think the LLM&#x27;s might have most impact by seriously accelerating the time it takes researchers to analyze their data. This could lead to an even greater volume of publications flooding our desks. If we are successful in solving that problem it might dramatically increase the quality of research being done.  I think the further development of BCI and mobile EEG together might be most promising. As EEG equipment becomes smaller and lighter, it can become more and more seamlessly integrated into daily life.   The development of AI is likely to give a turbo boost in the range and flexibility of interaction between the wearer and the wearable.\t\t\tAny wearable tech that has good spatial resolution and also the temporal resolution and low cost of EEG will replace EEG in the future.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEG\tI think one major step is that we&#x27;ve gotten much better at extracting information from the noisy EEG signal, both temporal and spatial.

For instance, we have to be careful with generalizing our EEG results, because they often come from relatively homogenous samples. This might be particularly critical, when trying, for instance, to develop a reliable BCI (also related to my answer below).  I don&#x27;t know if this barrier will or can be solved anytime soon, though. This is a more general and profound issue, than what strictly concerns EEG research.\tI think that a &quot;major breakthrough&quot; would still be related to the use of sophisticated and reliable BCIs. I know this topic is not exactly new, but even though there are promising results in this sense, as far as I&#x27;m aware, there is no consensus on what are the best methods (which components are we looking for and in what cognitive tasks, at what threshold, etc.?) that may be widely used to obtain reliable neurocorrelates in the context of rehabilitation.  Other major breakthrough will be probably more related to commercial uses. I would imagineill buy to obtain biofeedback. Kind of like what smartwatches are doing now, only with measurements from the brain directly.  And if such gadgets ever become commercially available, this would also open a whole new world for research. I can imagine that the possibilities are really incredible, if we were to have large amounts of public EEG data from highly ecological situations. I think correcting for motion artifacts and all other artifacts that would come from this, shouldn&#x27;t necessarily be an issue. AI could surely help disentangle these from &quot;real&quot; brain data much better and much faster than the human eye could.\tSee my previous comment related to BCIs and wearable EEG technology.  I think that these potential developments, particularly wearable EEG would have 2 major implications:  1- new avenues for research due to large amounts of ecological datasets, as already mentioned 2- prevention and early detection of certain neurological diseases that may be associated, for instance, with atypical brain oscillations.\tSo far, we almost exclusively focused on the brain. I think the future will bring forward new brain-spine- and even -peripheral nervous system interactions. Non-invasive spine EEG is already possible and done. I think EEG had the potential to help round this picture, and future long-term developments will probably focus on this matter.\tI don&#x27;t know. I guess MEG could replace EEG in many research labs, but as long as the price differences and efforts that are necessary to maintain these equipments remain so large, it is probably not going to happen anytime soon.\tMost of these statements feel like they may happen in the relatively near future, but I feel like estimating the actual number of years until they will be realised, is pure guessing.\tMy answer refers to tumors.

The next breaktrough was the recording of multichannel EEG and the topographic analysis of EEG (EEG mapping). The development of EEG source localization from single dipole localization to distributed source modeling was the next breakthrough. EEG source imaging of high-density together with realistic head models based on MRI converter EEG to na true brain imaging method. This conversion had high impact in the clinical use of EEG, for. example in the non-invasive localization of epileptic foci. Also cognitive neuroscience profit enormously from the ability to localize sensory cognitive functions in time and space. \t\tThere is still a high degree of misinterpretation of EEG due to a misunderstanding of the generation of scalp EEG through volume conduction. Too may wrong interpretations are made by assuming that the signal at a given scalp electrodes reflects neuronal activity directly underlying it. This misinterpretation risk to disqualify the EEG.\tA major breakthrough will be to bring high-density EEG and EEG source imaging to the field and leave the laboratory. Affordable portable high-density EEG will allow home-based recordings for many diseases and recordings in underdeveloped countries. Such EEG can become a portable, affordable, versatile neuroimaging method.\tPortable, affordable, easy-to-apply high-density EEG for monitoring of neuronal activity in the field.

In the last 20 years, the development of mathematical methods for isolating cortically sourced signals from the scalp-recorded mixed signal has been the greatest development, opening up enormous avenues for using EEG to cleanly model networks at the millisecond level (not possible with other common imaging methods based on blood flow). We are now in a position to do serious N=1 studies to examine subtle individual differences across participants instead of resting our studies entirely on group effects.\t\tIn commercial settings: the overly optimistic claims about EEG reflecting micro-cognitive levels, e.g., mind-reading, lie-detection, personality assessment. These are based on a misunderstanding of what generates our scalp-recorded EEG (or else are not honest claims). In research and clinical settings: the need to merge data sets with enough detail from each to be able test hypotheses strongly. This is currently being addressed fortunately, but has a long way to go yet for any measures other than simple spectral EEG (which has severe limitations).\tUser friendly &quot;cleaning&quot; systems so non-cortically generated EEG noise is eliminated, and cortical components can be examined. \t\t\tNo.\t\tSeizures are already detected by EEG. Tumours are suspected but proper imaging is needed for followup.\t\t\tNote that in medicine, &quot;accurate&quot; does not mean 100% but rather something that is useful in the mix of symptoms. \t\tCurrent neurofeedback therapy for ADHD is highly suspect, lacking objective reliable evidence. For anxiety, this is easier and possibly current but not terribly useful as other behavioural techniques are available and work.\tThere will be such claims (and may be already made), but the limitations are so huge that I don&#x27;t see them as useful clinically or for psychological research.\tAlready available but with severe limitations\t\tIn a limited way, e.g., to see about normal brain growth.\tIsn&#x27;t it already standard?\t\tAlready there are markers, but whether they are cost-effective compared to behavioural measures is a serious question.\tLong way off since this we have little consensus for this on various levels\t\tI don&#x27;t know well enough the current status of this.\tPossible but on a very limited basis limiting its acceptance and use.\tAlready possible so can be used any time..\t\tAlready possible but in a very limited way (making a cursor go up or down)\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is already being used as such but validation is problematic.\tAcceptance is an issue of cost and practical usefulness.\t\t\t\t\tAlready available to some extent, but always being updated with specifics since this is research field.\t\tAlready is available but not necessarily for 128-channel montages!\tSome training is always needed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEducational neurosciences\tFPVS\t\tResearch into intracranial epilepsy, a form that is resistant to drug treatment, and research into child development.\t\tUsing EEG in commercial settings can be critical at ethics level.\t\tIn the immediate future, I imagine that the system for fitting electrodes could be further perfected to save testing time in laboratory. Perhaps also an even easier system for cleaning between participants (single-use electrodes?) to save time in laboratory testing sessions. After that, in terms of analysis, I expect data pre-processing and processing software to be more efficient, with artificial intelligence to detect artefacts more effectively.\tI suppose that the developments will be at the medical level and between the machine/human interface.\tEverything will depend on the development of other neuroimaging tools and their costs. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderstanding the underlying neural dynamics of human behaviour and human cognition, clinical diagnostics (e.g. state of consciousness), understanding of brain dynamics (oscillations and their functions) and brain networks (source localization, connectivity), real-time data on brain processes. \t\tBarriers in research: availability of equipment, challenges to train with the method, issues with data quality, analysis practices are not uniform, replicability issues Clinical research: how to apply findings for translational research (e.g. to actually improve patient outcomes) Commercial: overselling findings, data quality issues, lack of training among other scientists than neuroscientists, competition - companies claiming too much - issues to record with very few channels but products are still sold\tAI based EEG data analysis Better BCI systems More mobile systems  Clinical and research foci - for analysis \tBetter dry electrode systems Combination with other neuroimaging technologies  Wider access for more participant and patient groups Self-application, neurofeedback\tFully portable devices, small size, on the go data analysis, automated processing of data, multilab replications\tSome areas where fNIRS can be better utilized - some infant research studies\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talready can be done no?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHopefully at some point but feels like never :D \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCombining EEG with real-time statistical machine learning techniques has given birth to the very exciting field of non-invasive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Whilst EEG continues to underpin most non-invasive BCI research, we are seeing it combined with other hybrid modalities (fNIRS, EMG etc.) and the complementary fields of robotics and shared control, which is enabling Brain Machine Interfaces to be evaluated and even used outside the laboratory setting. Consequently we are seeing clinical application of these closed-loop EEG-based systems in neurorehabilitation and some assistive technologies.\t\tIn commercial settings there is a risk that EEG is beginning to be seen as plug-and-play, yet in reality a lot of skill is still required to mount and calibrate the electrodes to ensure good signal quality. Most BCIs require substantial training time and support from expert researchers. Therefore, there is a risk to the BCI community that early commercialisation of such technology could be mis-sold to / misinterpreted by the public, which could harm future investment and trust. It could be argued that a similar fate was bestowed upon the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as it followed a rollercoaster of success and setbacks, before making the recent significant leaps forward in generative AI.\tThere are 3 current developments that will lead to major breakthroughs towards daily usage of Brain Computer Interfaces: (1) Improvements to the hardware itself: moving away from the functional elements and considering more ergonomics and human factors. We are already seeing more comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, wireless, dry-electrode systems, but currently they often come at a cost in terms of reduced signal quality. (2) Hybrid systems that combine complementary modalities (e.g. fNIRS) to yield a more robust system. (3) Shared control systems, which enable the user&#x27;s EEG to be interpreted in the context in which the BCI is operating (akin to driving assistance, or predictive text), will improve decoding accuracy, robustness and reduce user workload.\t\t\tFor some patients, who may elect to be long-term BCI users, an invasive approach may well yield better signals, supporting higher information transfer rates and better accuracies, supporting them to perform a range of activities of daily living. Nevertheless there are obvious costs and risks associated with surgery. Therefore, I believe there will always be a role for EEG in Brain Computer Interfaces for the majority of users who will simply not wish to elect for surgery. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderstanding the role of neural oscillations in cognition.

THE most relevant application is the classification of seizures and epilepsy.   Currently, long term or continuous EEG is technically and computationally ready for application. Neurologists could evaluate seizures, spells and transient cortical symptoms in the same way as cardiologists, internists and intensivists do. You cant sell a concept, method or device developed by neurologists/neurophysiologists to a neurologist. Therfore, modern EEG must be sold to geriatricians, neuropsychologists, neurorafiologists and psychiatrists FIRST. \tNeuro-Critical care by non-neurologists\tNew EEG tools, like algorithms, quantifications, spike detectors etc. are required to be commercialised (by funders, co-financing rules, valorisation grants etc.).

For instance, recording of 4-10 channels of hairline-EEG along with EKG and sound or acceleration for 10-30 nights would greatly help in patients suspected of seizures from sleep or at risk for Sudep. This can be done at home, most patients could apply 4-6 electrodes themselves. Data acquisition and transfer would be perfectly feasible with smartphone technology.

This will allow for better brain-computer interface and perhaps lead to novel understanding of cognitive processes that may find clinical applications.\tIn the next 100 years, I would hope that EEG will have been used in psychological assessments and to track treatment of neural-markers of psychopathology.\tI believe that models of the brain will simulate EEG data during certain processes well enough that real human participants will not be necessary early in the development of programs of research.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tamplitude modulation spectra\t\t\t\tethical use of collected data in the wild\t\tpassive BCI applications\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLack of training in experimental design, clinical trial design, and statistical methods.\t- availability of open standardised datasets to test and compare methods - availability of open high-resolution standardised atlases - improved head models - improved source localisation approaches using better resolution structural/anatomical MRI data; - combining EEG with multimodal data such as MEG and diffusion weighted imaging\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere will be an trend for that soon, but won&#x27;t last long\t\t\tNot sure it is a good idea though\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor breakthroughs include understanding epilepsy and how best to treat it; the neurophysiological characteristics of adhd; and neurophysiological development and change across the lifespan\t\tWe\u2019ve got so many products available on the market and few have been rigorously tested to verify their quality against traditional EEG recording devices.\t\tReal-time monitoring of people\u2019s attention during class and work, and the possibility of intervening to enhance productivity \tNot sure \tNot sure \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne of the major breakthrough in ERP research (specifically) that I think is important is the use of trial level data, thereby broadening the attention towards stability and variance of the neural responses.\t\tOne of the major barriers to increasing the clinical implications of EEG is that the tasks or paradigms that are used to elicit ERPs are not designed for clinical use, leading to a gap between research and clinical practice. Hence, more work on the development of measurement that is useful in clinical settings is warranted.\t\tI expect to see a more streamlined process of preprocessing and interpreting EEG data. I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that I expect everything to be standardized, but I expect increased understanding of the impact of the different decision making process involved in EEG research.\tOne thing would be the increased clinical utility of EEG technology, not only in neurological disorder, but also in psychiatric disorders. Enhancing the use of EEG technology in elaborating brain-behavior relationship will increase the understanding of atypical behavior in psychopathology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNever widely but I can see how it may be an additional tool\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the use of the EEG has been significant for understanding the psychophysiology of mental processes, the more substantial impact of the EEG is its application in the clinical investigation of seizure, sleep, and consciousness disorders. Unfortunately, other areas of clinical neurosciences have not yet received a breakthrough by the daily use of the EEG. From a technical point of view, EEG is one of the most helpful and influential tools for several applications in emotional, cognitive, and motor rehabilitation through powerful and flexible methods, such as brain-computer interface (BCI) or neurofeedback (NFB).\tneurofeedback\tAs a psychiatrist, my concerns are mainly in the context of EEG use in clinical psychiatry and, more in general, in mental health, including the identification of &quot;at-risk mental states&quot;. A barrier is the diffuse absence of a culture of the use of EEG as a clinical and research routine for people affected by mental illnesses. A risk in the development of EEG application may be the lack of a general, scientific approach that regulates or, better, addresses the application in a clinical context, determining an attenuation of the (potential) impact of the EEG.\tThe significant advance with EEG could be in the application of artificial intelligence tools (i.e., machine learning and deep learning) in managing data from different analytical approaches (i.e., linear and non-linear methods, at the sensors and sources level, as well as computational modelling) both in areas of clinical neurosciences that had already received advances in the past both in those that did not have yet clinical benefits.\tRegarding EEG technology, I expect an increase in faster multilevel analyses and the diffusion of wearable devices. Those two general aspects may improve, in several clinical neuroscientific contexts, the clinical characterization in defining an accurate bio(pheno)type useful for (individualization of) the treatment and prognosis. \tThe main expectation is a widespread diffusion of simple, easy-to-use EEG tools that can be worn by subjects in different contexts and allow monitoring and analysis of brain electrical activity in real-time, thus facilitating the use of information for clinical purposes.\tNo\tNo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGeorge H. W. Bush authorized the Human Brain Project in 1990 and authorized over 2 billion dollars for the first decade.  I was a NIH project leader at the time and helped to evaluate and fund a variety of quantitative EEG (QEEG) and MEG grants.  I was also responsible for the development of the first 128 channel EEG system to aid in inverse EEG source solutions.  Brain networks were evaluated using PET, SPECT, QEEG and MEG and the 1909 Brodmann areas were evaluated and confirmed.   Brain network software was developed, e.g., EEG/MEG coherence and phase differences and information flow, etc. to further confirm the existence of Brodmann areas that corresponded to unique cytoarchitectures in each area.  The 2nd decade of the Human Brain Project involved a 2nd approximate 2 billion dollars in funding to further evaluate brain networks and to combine different imaging methods.   This science helped further develop quantitative EEG which has resulted over 160,000 QEEG peer reviewed publications cited in the National Library of Medicine database (e.g., Pubmed).\t\tQEEG was first used by Hans Berger in 1934 and used to measures scalp recorded electricity for nearly 100 years with no reports of injury.    Today high school and college students routinely measure their EEG at home and school with no harm.  This is because today\u2019s inexpensive EEG amplifiers have protections to prevent any reverse direction of electricity to a person\u2019s scalp and the standards are specified by the FDA since the 1980s.  The biggest risk is false information about possible harm to measuring the EEG and then using invalid digital methods to distort replace a patient\u2019sEEG without their knowledge nor consent.  The greatest risk is distortion of a patient\u2019s digital EEG data using Independent Components Analysis (ICA) to then allegedly remove artifact using ICA replacement (ICA) of the patient\u2019s original EEG by using a smaller number of ICA components to recreate a different and distorted time series without the patient\u2019s knowledge or permission.

Consensus by Experts Confirming Alteration of Phase Differences by ICA Replacement (ICA-R) Professionals at the University of California at San Diego EEGLablist that have numerous public discussions and evaluations of ICA have independently confirmed that ICA replacement alters phase differences. For example:   1- \u201cIf you remove IC and reconstruct channel EEG by back projecting the remaining ICs, of course it changes channel EEG phase!\u201d (Makoto Miyakoshi, Eeglablist ICA and signal phase content, Sept. 16, 2014)   2- \u201cThe EEG reconstruction after removing bad components/sources MAY change the phase value of the signal at any electrode.\u201d (M. Rezazadeh Eeglablist ICA and signal phase content, Sept. 18, 2014).   3- \u201cThe reconstructed data after removing spurious ICA components differs from the original time series, and because of that there are phase differences.\u201d (Arnaud Delorme, Eeglablist ICA misinformation, June 10, 2017). \\  4- \u201cI first noticed the problem with phase distortion more than a decade ago\u201d (Robert Lawson, Eeglablist ICA misinformation, June 14, 2017).   5- \u201cI think he is right that the relative phase will be changed by deleting 1 or 2 artifact components.\u201d (Ramesh Srinivasan, Eeglablist ICA misinformation, June 14, 2017).   6- \u201cWe found phase distortions in the 8-10 Hz alfa band (greatest near the source of artefact) but also on more remote electrodes such as occipital and also in artefact free strokes of EEG.\u201d (Georges Otte, Eeglablist ICA misinformation, June 15, 2017).

Additionally, the objective measurement of cognitive abilities in patients who cannot speak, including small children, should be considered as major breakthrough. Science of sleep has received a major boost thanks to the adoption of EEG, beginning with the classification of sleep stages to clinical diagnostics. EEG-based BCIs and neurological rehabilitation look promising. Age-related and cognitive abnormalities are reflected in EEG, however, to my knowledge, these measures are still too noisy to provide clinicians with informative insights.\t\tEEG is cheap. This makes it potentially available for a large customer base. Individual medicine might be one to keep an eye on. Companies probably want to sell the idea, and it seems quite plausible, that having a valid baseline and larger quantity of data about their clients would eventually lead to earlier discovery and intervention of a disease.

The technique has been a cornerstone in the neuroscientific field, helping us understand the brain&#x27;s complex dynamics and offering tools and technologies that bring tangible benefits to society.\t\tSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Spatial Resolution Limitations, Clinical Interpretation, Standardization-Different labs or clinics might use varying methodologies, electrode placements, or analysis techniques. This lack of standardization can lead to inconsistent results, making it challenging to compare or integrate findings across studies or institutions.Commercial Overreach.\tWearable and Wireless EEG, Machine Learning and AI Integration, Advanced Source Localization Techniques, hybrid system, Closed-loop Systems, expended neurofeedback applications.Brain-computer interfaces are seeing applications in gaming, virtual reality, and even as assistive technologies. As the technology becomes more streamlined and affordable, BCIs could become as ubiquitous as smartphones, allowing direct brain interaction with digital platforms.\tMiniaturization and Enhanced Portability, Improved Signal Processing, AI-driven Real-time Analysis, Enhanced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Comprehensive Integration with Other Technologies-Integration of EEG with other biometric tools, such as heart rate monitors or eye-tracking systems, could provide a holistic understanding of an individual&#x27;s state, Affordable and High-resolution Devices.\tNon-contact EEG, Full brain mapping, Seamless Brain-Computer Integration, Neuro-enhancement and Training-Advanced EEG-driven neurofeedback might allow individuals to &quot;train&quot; specific cognitive or emotional skills, optimizing brain function for specific tasks or states.This could redefine education, professional training, and mental health interventions, allowing for tailored cognitive enhancements.Predictive Brain Modeling, Global Neural Networks- Drawing a parallel to today&#x27;s digital networks, future EEG tech might facilitate neural networks, where individuals can share, amalgamate, or even &quot;stream&quot; cognitive experiences.This could redefine social interactions, education, and collective decision-making. It would also raise profound questions about individuality, privacy, and societal structures.\tSocial Neuroscience \t\t0\t10\t5\t5\t0\t0\t5\t0\t5\t19\t20\t10\t10\t5\t10\t10\t10\t10\t5\t37\t25\t25\t10\t5\t10\t50\t0\t7\t29\t50\t100\t50\t50\t29\t20\t10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEEG source imaging and epilepsy \t\t\tOne of the main breakthrough of EEG was its application in epilepsy from the early days, to more advanced development through advanced source imaging, being used more and more during presurgical investigation of patients with epilepsy, to more recent development in the characterization of resting state brain networks and functionnal connectivity patterns. \tEpilepsy\tOne of the main challenge of EEG is careful validation of the proposed methods, especially source imaging methods. Whereas wearable EEG device are becoming more and more used, carefully validation of the quality of the recordings is still lacking.  \tEven if validation is difficult, development of wearable EEG together with advanced data analysis to assess resting state brain to monitor cognition in healthy and pathological conditions.  \tMore and more wearable EEG device, either low resolution with AI to assist / interact with social cognition (e.g. during video game, while driving, workload detector), or high resolution, to improve personalized diagnostic at home, while allowing spatio-temporal imaging. \tEEG will for sure assist our everyday life and might become a very powerful tool, assessing our workload, fatigue, but also ability to train/practice, while remaining a unique diagnostic tool.\tEEG is for sure in competition with other wearable devices such as fNIRS or MEG OPM, but I think they will feature sufficient complementarity so that their combine use will probably allow most interesting applications \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t0\t0\t\t10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22-33\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe major breakthroughs for me were:  1.

Interpretation from a physical viewpoint and not merely to show that there are some differences between conditions, i.e. quantitative research \t\tEEG is very simple to tinker with, but underneath the surface there are a lot of complex issues that must be understood to use it properly. One needs an understanding of physiology, signal processing and cognitive science together. This necessity of multidisciplinary thinking is a substantial challenge.  The risk is improper interpretation. E.g. some psychologists not measure precise latencies, and some engineers might not use proper controls to exclude confounds \tAI-based techniques e.g., dimension reduction for massively complex data  Fusion of modalities  Better understanding of the underlying principles, many of which are unclear at the mid-level (e.g., nonlinear/complex approaches)\tFlexible and smaller sensors, would make research easier especially with children \tThis timeframe is difficult to extrapolate to, but I foresee a merger of EEG with deeper electrophysiological measures (MUA/LFP).

The low cost and portability of EEG has made it valuable for many diverse patient groups.  Sleep staging: While there are behavioural correlates of sleep stages, a full understanding of the stages of sleep, their mechanisms, and their value for the awake organism wouldn&#x27;t be possible without EEG. This feeds into understanding and helping those with sleep disorders, as well as understanding bigger philosophical questions about consciousness and wakefulness.  Cognitive neuroscience: For me, some of the best cognitive applications of EEG have been ERP studies in the 1990s of the various cognitive processes proposed by Tulving to underly episodic memory encoding and retrieval. They are I think clear examples of the benefit of EEG for testing predictions about whether two processes are dissociable, and in what temporal order they occur.\t\tThe same things that affect all of science currently: reproducibility and replicability. EEG is inexpensive and widely available, so it is straightforward to run an EEG study and find evidence of some clinical marker or something of commercial value, e.g., neuromarketing. The barrier is to ensure that studies are well-powered, grounded in theory, protected from QRPs, and conducted openly.\tImprovements in other head-mounted devices could eventually combine to provide rich multi-modal data simultaneously, which (if we can work out how to model it) could give a clearer insight into the underlying neural activity - i.e., EEG with OPMs and fNIRS in one cap.\t\tI played around with some subdermal EEG electrodes during my postdoc, which were tiny needle-like electrodes that went into the skin of the scalp. They were designed for long-term clinical monitoring, but the signal quality was extremely high as they are in the skin itself, but also not as invasive as ecog etc. Especially with portable and commercial applications of EEG, signal quality is a significant barrier. Subdermal electrodes that can be worn without it hurting or giving concerns about infection would be invaluable in solving the signal quality issues. This would need some futuristic development in electrode size and materials though.\tNo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general categories of content only\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- frequency analyeses on EEG signals - BCIs\t\t- mobile EEG not controlling for movement - too cheap devices with low signal quality\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBrain-Computer Interfacing\tMEG\tI consider the adoption of EEG outside the neurological (clinical) context a major breakthrough. EEG was the first technique that allowed us to go beyond behavioral (reaction time) experiments and has shed light on the sequential and parallel nature of cortical processing (perception, decision making, action preparation and execution, and monitoring).\t\tThe biggest barrier to me is that neither the EEG signal nor the artifacts have changed over the years, but that naive researchers/people expect that new hardware makes the acquisition of EEG easier. Of course it is easier (cheaper, faster, more noise resilient) in some regards, but that still does not make it easy. Affordable consumer-grade EEG systems create expectations that are not met in reality. Related to this is that poor communication about how the brain and cognition works leads to expectations among people and non-neuroscience researchers that are similar to phrenology, i.e., how can we use EEG to simply assess attention, emotion, memory or other cognitive constructs without understanding the complexity of those constructs. Luckily somehow people never ask me how to assess IQ using EEG, but that would have been a question in the same domain - except I guess there people understand or (want to) accept that IQ is too complex to be measured with a device as a single number, whereas for other contents that belief still seems to exist.\tOpenly sharing of EEG data. Initially that will result in a lot of inefficient data reuse, but I hope and expect that researchers at large will start realizing the complexity of both the data and the influence of the experimental conditions in which it was recorded on the features in the data. \tWider adoption of wearable (cap-mounted, no wires) EEG systems and collection of large EEG datasets in ecologically more realistic settings. Having not 10 or 100 hours of data to work with, but 10.000 or 100.000 will make a big difference.   \tI expect due to miniaturization and increased energy efficiency the line between non-invasive (transient) and invasive (chronical) recording methods to blur. We might have systems that we wear like glasses or ear-buds or patches on our skin, but might also have relatively minor implantable systems _under_ the skin that continuously monitor neural activity. \tNo, not because of other technologies. I can imagine people loosing their interest though, if other (non-biological) ways of thinking about our psyche and self take over. \t\tother methods like MRI, MEG and iEEG will remain dominant \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI expect that behavioral recordings will always remain better\t\t\t\t\tbecause of ethical reasons\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI don&#x27;t expect this because of ethical reasons, not because of technology\t\t\tthere is already, but only within sub-domains.

I think that industry is going to start moving a lot faster than traditional academic/medical research settings, which means that the widespread consumer use of EEG might outflank research and regulations around it.

In this context, a major breakthrough pertains to the diagnosis of epilepsy (but also sleep disorders) in neurology, I think, for which EEG provides the gold standard diagnostic method.    In research, in psychology and neuroscience, EEG has steadily grown up to become nowadays a main investigation technique used to explore the organization and implementation of a myriad of brain processes, spanning from sensory processing to decision making. In this context, a major breakthrough concerns the discovery and characterization of specific EEG oscillations (theta, alpha, beta, gamma) contributing to cognition and more generally information processing in the (human) brain.    \t\tEEG, unlike other methods, can easily be used and does not have big barriers, I think. If asked to mention one however, I would say &quot;the wires&quot; (i.e. literally the ones connecting the EEG sensors to the amplifier). I would suspect that EEG wireless technology, which is still in its infancy, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, could yield new and significant breakthroughs in cognitive but also clinical neuroscience. Wireless means that other technological barriers will probably have to be overcome, related to electrodes/sensors, but also data handling and processing in a wireless environment. This way, the ecological validity of EEG could increase substantially. Accordingly, the ecological validity of EEG is still limited and I see this as a big barrier.     \tEEG data sharing (e.g. #EEGmanylabs), but also the use of open-source software and applications are new developments that should lead to rapid changes and breakthroughs in the use of EEG.    \tI wish and hope brain-computer interface (BCI) based on EEG will substantially develop and grow up the coming years as it bears a huge potential in Cognitive but also Clinical Neuroscience. Combined with technological advancements (e.g. wireless EEG), BCI based on EEG might lead to new major scientific discoveries (about the brain), but also novel treatments or interventions based on this specific technology (BCI).   \tEEG electrodes and sensors (including at the scalp level) will not only record EEG, but also be able to directly influence and alter it. Hence, EEG will be used for entrainment, learning and brain plasticity because it will be combined or (better) integrated with online &quot;(neuro)stimulations&quot; techniques (like what we now know and use with TMS or tDCS). In turn, people or even patients could wear devices that will use/record EEG, but will also be able to influence online this neurophysiological signal, with the goal to change and improve learning and behavior. If working successfully, a new range of applications meant to treat neurological or affective disorders could open and develop. A second innovation (in the long run) could be to better relate EEG (e.g. specific/new EEG correlates yet to be discovered) to neurotransmission or specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin). In this (science-fiction) scenario, EEG would also help test and develop new drugs (used to treat affective or neurological disorders).        \tI don&#x27;t think so, the specificity of EEG will still prevail and remain. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh-density EEG, source estimation, and the computer power to take advantage of these. \t\tResearch - although the ease of access (due to low cost) to EEG is in general desirable, it does pose a risk of inexperienced users publishing poor work.

For that, I do not believe EEG will ever be suited, but maybe other tests (eg. blood samples) might.\tI am not sure it would ever be refined enough to be useful for such purposes.\tIt may be an aid, but never standard, as in future the idea of mental health diagnoses will (hopefully) be altogether different from the mess it is now. \tIf we can ever define cognitive states of emotions properly.\t\t\t\t\tI just don&#x27;t really understand what exactly is meant by &quot;enhance cognitive performance&quot;.

The more recent advancement in mobile EEG technology has major implications for understanding brain activity during movement which the last 10 years or so has just started to unlock.   Clinically, there have been important uses of EEG to detect seizures and related conditions. While some evidence has pointed toward clinical identification, treatment and related bio-feedback has been a major development toward integrating EEG into regular use and improving people&#x27;s quality of life. \t\tTO get high-quality EEG across many electrodes is not cheap or quick to administer. Clinical research and applications often have limitations related to these things that prevent advancements. It is also very difficult to use EEG for diagnostic purposes, which may have discouraged use of it, even though there can be beneficial implications and uses in treatment. \tMobile EEG and wearable devices people can purchase for low-cost can get more people using and integrating EEG into daily life. This is already happening, and I believe it is likely to gain more popularity as new technology like AR/VR glasses are released which may eventually include EEG electrodes. \tInclusion of EEG in more wearable devices, such as AR/VR glasses. \tAt some point, I am convinced people will wear and use EEG electrodes in a a similar way to how many are using technology like apple watches to track their heart rates and activity. \tIf smaller, wearable devices become more advanced and can inform us of key implications in daily life, the use of full scalp EEG may become less popular - although still warranted for full-brain exploration \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMobile EEG and dry EEG electrodes\t\t\tWearables and gamification\tData sharing\treal time EEG to internet communication\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ability to characterise spectral dysfunctions in neurological disorders, and the discovery of markers for sensory and cognitive processes.\t\t1.

For example, how different areas are suppressed or other ones get an activation &quot;boost&quot;, in order to achieve the desired response.  The more and more the EEG process becomes fine-tuned technologically, the better precision we have. Hence, current techniques like cluster-based permutations give us the power to look into larger amount of electrodes and time-points. The machinery of it has been improved significantly, so the EEG physical tools work more reliably, too.\t\tWe know more about what happens in the brain where but I think we still need further conceptual knowledge to understand better what these processes exactly mean for cognition.\tThis isn&#x27;t particularly so current, but I believe the application of using EEG in combination with fMRI answers a lot of questions about where and what exactly happens in the brain.

From a clinical perspective, its contribution to diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis are remarkable.\tBrain-body connections for cognition\tThe relatively low spatial resolution of EEG has been an important factor for many neuroscientists to choose not to use this technique.\tI think that identification of EEG biomarkers for early detection, tracking, and prognosis of neurological disorders would be a major breakthrough. \tImprovement of spatial resolution coupled with temporal resolution, and portable EEG systems will make a difference in clinical and ecologically valid settings.\tPotentially, continuous monitoring of EEG and inter-subject analysis (phase coupling, coherence, etc) would have a strong impact.\tOnly in the case that other technologies achieve a similar temporal resolution and cover the same neurophysiological principles of cooperation and integration under non-invasive conditions, EEG would become redundant.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\taffective neuroscience\t\t\tDevelopments of hardware: increasing number of electrodes; improved signal quality; reduced cost; increased portability systems, including wirelessness; dry electrodes  Development of analysis algorithms: time-frequency approaches; SSVEP; source localization; coherence; machine learning  Development in inferences and theory: spectral signatures of sleep stages; ERPs as useful correlates of psychological processes; developments in uncovering the role oscillations; brain-computer interface  \t\tOne barrier is the limited harmonization of preprocessing and analysis approaches, which inflates researcher degrees of freedom. \tI&#x27;m sure machine learning is providing exciting avenues in EEG, but I&#x27;m not that familiar with the latest developments.\tI really haven&#x27;t thought of this before, so just brainstorming.  In terms of hardware, one interesting avenue might be more convenient integration with other brain-related technologies such as fNIRS or transcranial direct stimulation and various behavioral and self-report measures such as geolocations, mobile and computer use patterns etc.   Scientifically, this could generate contextually rich and multidimensional data about various experiences. And these in turn could facilitate more realistic understanding of psychological process, including applying idiographic analysis and explanatory models (i.e. not only the levels of predictors but also the sets of predictros could differ between people).   In terms of analysis, we will probably see new and clever applications of machine learning to EEG data (also as part of multimodal datasets described above). I don&#x27;t have anything specific in mind, I just assume that there are gains to be had across all functions of science, so describing and explaining them better, predicting them better (e.g. more valid and reliable correlates of processes) and being able to influence them (e.g. just in time delivery of psychological or even neural stimulation interventions). \t\tI can&#x27;t think of a scenario where it would become completely redundant. But it&#x27;s functions may well shift, and it&#x27;s importance decrease.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere will always be a limit on the specificity of such encodings because, but broad distinction between e.g. focused and bored are possible\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause mental health disorders are mostly not brain disorder\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly if we define &quot;ERP component&quot; as a conjunction of time, location, and specific task\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

The electrode cap application is cumbersome.  2. A decent EEG recording machine is still as expensive as a car.  3. There is wild differences in literacy among EEG users. There are many EEG users because recording an EEG signal is not very difficult. But that does not mean they have extensive knowledge about generative mechanism of EEG. The conversations across these variety of EEG users, including specialists in the related fields, have not been very active or efficient due to differences in their backgrounds.\tI believe hardware development for a safe and affordable chronic implantation of high-density ECoG electrodes for passive BCI will revolutionize humanity. It will open the possibility for a science fiction-like society. Scalp EEG would not be good enough for this because (1) the high-density electrode application is cumbersome (2) this is more fundamental reason, but scalp-recorded EEG loses so much information compared with ECoG due to volume conduction and the blur effect that occurs in the interface of skull and scalp.\tMy wishful thinking is that I want to see the revival of the global field theory proposed by Paul Nunez. The corresponding movements can be found in fMRI, like Alex Fornito&#x27;s Nature paper in the beginning of this year. But they can&#x27;t explain the nature of the traveling waves in the BOLD signals. In the case of EEG, the medium of the traveling wave is defined as synaptic action field whose conductance speed is predicted and confirmed to fit with that of white matter.\tSafe and affordable chronic implanatation of ECoG with wireless signal transmission 24/7 to a server on which machine learning is constantly learning the relation between a person&#x27;s daily behaviors including all decision makings and corresponding high-resolution (both spatially and temporally) electric cortical mapping. The basic technology for this goal does not have to be studied on humans, we can make, for example, ECoG dogs whose brain states are constantly read and updated on the owner&#x27;s smart phone.  We need to see, however, a very powerful external force to make it happen. Like a Neuralink.\tMany of EEG applications are already unnecessary. For example, there are many EEG users because they can&#x27;t casually use MRI.

Initially, it was somewhat rudimentary and required invasive methods, but it has evolved into a sophisticated, non-invasive technology extensively used in neuroscience and medicine. Significant advancements include the transition from analog to digital systems, the advent of wireless EEG for more accessible long-term monitoring, and the integration of AI for complex data analysis. Despite its limitations in spatial resolution and susceptibility to interference, EEG remains an indispensable tool for diagnosing and studying various neurological conditions. A notable challenge in EEG research is the standardization of the data cleaning process. Additionally, the replication rate of EEG studies, which remains largely unquantified, is crucial for validating the reliability and consistency of EEG findings.\tBasic research\tStandardization of all the process. For example, some researchers are quite liberal and others quite strict when cleaning the data. Without such standardization, it might be difficult to reproduce the exact process in a replication study. \tI&#x27;m not entirely sure, but I think there&#x27;s potential for interconnection in research and application between EEG and neuromorphic computing. In the future, the capability of neuromorphic systems to process information in a brain-like manner might significantly enhance how we interpret EEG data.\tIt would be great to combine EEG recording with non-invasive brain stimulation technique such as deep rTMS. \tno idea.

The development of portable and wearable EEG devices in the 21st century has democratized brain monitoring. These devices enable real-time monitoring of brain activity in diverse settings, opening up new possibilities for research, diagnostics, and even consumer applications.

Good EEG measurements are still difficult, and their reputation suffers because of these poor attempts \tI&#x27;m not sure \tI think there is potential in merging EEG with virtual reality and using EEG to adaptively change visual or auditory input. \tSome sort of dystopian wakefulness tracking comes to mind... \tMaybe OPM_MEG will replace EEG in research settings? \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEEG has seen many significant breakthroughs over the past 100 years. Here are some of the major milestones and their impact:  Identification of different brain waves: Researchers in the 1930s identified different brain wave patterns, such as alpha, beta, delta, and theta waves, each associated with different states of consciousness. Implications: The identification of different brain waves provided insights into various states of consciousness and activity, including sleep, relaxation, and wakefulness.  Diagnosis of epilepsy: EEG has been used to detect abnormal electrical patterns in the brain associated with epilepsy. Impact: This non-invasive method revolutionized the diagnosis and study of epilepsy, leading to improved treatment and understanding of the disease.  Evoked potentials: In the 1950s, researchers developed the capability to measure the brain&#x27;s responses to specific sensory stimuli. Impacts: This discovery allowed for detailed studies of sensory processing and the cognitive functions of the brain.  Brain-Computer Interfaces: Pioneering steps were taken to develop systems allowing direct communication between the brain and computers. Impact: BCI technology holds the promise of enabling people with paralysis or other motor disorders to communicate or control external devices using their thoughts.  Real-time neurofeedback: Patients and participants can now view their brain activity in real-time and learn to modulate it. Implications: This technique has been employed in therapies for ADHD, anxiety, and other conditions.  EEG in cognitive neuroscience: The integration of EEG with other imaging modalities, such as fMRI, offers insights into cognitive processes and networks. Implications: This combination enables a more comprehensive understanding of how different brain regions collaborate on various cognitive tasks.  Portable and wearable EEG: With the advent of miniaturized wireless EEG systems in the 2010s, recording brain activity outside the laboratory became feasible. Implications: This technological leap expanded the applications of EEG to areas like meditation, gaming, and other everyday activities. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think that EEG might be used together with other tecniques suc as NIBS and fMRI tin order to minimize the limits of each single tecnique.\t\tThe only limitation is that EEG cannot be used in ecological backgrouns\t\tMore easy way to use hd cups, more standardized methodologies to analyze eeg data. going beyond avarage.\tno idea\tno idea\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- detection of disturbances of brain activity in epilepsy - dissociation of ongoing activity (e.g. alpha oscillations) and evoked activity\t\ttoo low spatial resolution (i.e. too unspecific signals)\t\tBetter understanding of cortical circuits may lead to a better understanding of the neurophysiological sources of EEG.

While medical disciplines went chasing after the latest fads in imaging and abandoned EEG in research and clinical applications (except in epileptology and polysomnography), the use of EEG as a method of functional neuroimaging has flourished. Moreover, improvements in computerized spatial modeling and sensor noise reduction have harnessed the superior temporal resolution of EEG tomography and have further refined the spatial resolution of EEG such that we can reliably use EEG in clinical and research applications without the ridiculously exorbitant costs of fMRI/MRI/SPECT/PET. EEG has much greater facility and a near zero risk to harm to the subject as opposed to the risk to harm presented by other imaging technologies.\t\tThe biggest barrier is posed by the community of neurologist who insist that only a neurologist can read and interpret EEG and who also cast aspersions at those who use quantitative EEG, EEG databases, and the inverse solutions (sLORETA, eLORETA, swLORETA) for source localization. While we have gained broad acceptance in behavioral neuroscience, the medical community - aided and abetted by big pharma - has always been the biggest barrier to acceptance of EEG in clinical setting (like EEG biofeedback/neurofeedback). These methods do not get the same level of funding as others for these reasons and that needs to be addressed.\tEEG databases that track the developmental and aging processes across the lifespan will have great utility in tracking brain health, especially in the era of pandemics and the head injury crisis.\tMachine learning for developing and refining EEG neurometrics for a variety of clinical and behavioral health applications Improvements in wearable technology making them less intrusive and providing higher quality signal processing Continued miniaturization of computers and associates technologies Open source EEG databases\tRealtime non-invasive neuroimaging in primary care facilities, sports-medicine clinics, and public school sports programs People will be getting non-invasive brain imaging done as a part of their annual physicals\tIt&#x27;s not likely give the cost of EEG - it&#x27;s hard to see a cheaper solution that provides the same information concerning the brain&#x27;s electrical activity - I believe EEG advances will make other, more costly technologies obsolete - not the other way around.\t\t0\t0\t0\t0\t2-5\t2-5\t0\t10\t0\t5-10\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t2-5\t5-10\t0\t0\t0\t2-5\t5-10\t0\t2-5\t\t\t20\t20\t10\t\t2-5\t\t10\t5-10\t0\t5-10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPattern analyses both to understand the brain and for BCI applications\t\tlong time to prepare the subject (wet electrodes)  signal dropouts (dry electrodes)\tDecodability of brain signals and commanding to computer interfaces to help with disabled patients.\tbetter signal quality in the mobile eeg applications  better source localization techniques\tmobile eeg equipment replacing wet electrodes in terms of signal quality and speed.\tnot likely\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn my view, the major impact of EEG on society in the past century has been its use in clinical neurology. I would also like to point out an &quot;absence of breakthrough&quot; in that clinical EEG is still read &quot;by eye&quot; and that quantitative methods only assist this old-fashioned technique, rather than replace it.  The other major breakthrough of EEG has been the development of cognitive neuroscience research using intracranial EEG. Its unrivalled spatial and temporal resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio enable true progress in understanding how the brain represents and produces speech signals. This is on the verge of leading to usable Brain-Computer Interfaces to restore speech in neurological patients.\t\tScalp EEG in research: risk of associating sensor-level findings with focal brain activity. Lack of understanding of how EEG signals are generated may lead to false statement (e.g. changes in ERP amplitude and &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; brain activation).  Scalp EEG in the clinics: failure to recognize that quantitative techniques (AI-based feature search and detection, or summarized presentation of long-term recordings) can significantly improve clinical performance.\tTechnological (almost) breakthroughs: - fully implantable wireless intracranial EEG - multi-channel wearable &quot;dry&quot; scalp EEG  Analytical breakthroughs: - combination of very large EEG datasets with automated learning for feature detection and decoding\tReducing the invasiveness of intracranial EEG, e.g. with soft electronics.  Progress in non-invasive neuromodulation, coupled with EEG, for more targeted interventions (in space and time).\tIntracranial EEG systems with biodegradable materials that provide signals for a while and are then &quot;cleared&quot; by the body&#x27;s immune system.  Chronic implants could provide enhancement to some cerebral functions, like online translating of speech into other languages.  Overall much higher therapeutic impact of BCI and closed-loop brain stimulation systems (for movement disorders and epilepsy but possibly whole new indications).\tThe traditional &quot;wet&quot; scalp EEG is likely to become redundant with progress in &quot;dry&quot; electrode systems.  If it becomes possible to implant fully wireless intracranial EEG systems with relatively minor invasiveness (see above), then scalp EEG for long-term monitoring might disappear\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReal-time BCI\t\tIgnoring the nature of the EEG signals and their biophysical origins  \tSkin like EEG sensors, clinical use daily \tSee prior response\tSee prior response\tNo, it remains more versatile, light, cheap than other neuroimaging technique\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tmicrostates\t\tI believe that Lehmann&#x27;s microstates will eventually prove to be a landmark discovery in that I suspect these will be shown to track the sequential engagement patterns of resting state networks. The sequential patterning of these states may reveal dynamic organizing principles which could prove crucial to optimizing the therapeutic potential for closed loop neuromodulation. I see a future where large brain models (LBMs) could be trained on vocabularies of microstates with transformers identifying patterns indicative of impaired functioning in a similar manner to how large language models (LLMs) are trained. These LBMs could then be fine-tuned for evaluation of individually optimized neurostimulation treatment protocols for a wide range of brain disorders.  \t\tEase of application/acquisition\tRe-usable, wearable sensors that could streamline the ease of data acquisition\tAs noted earlier, I beleive that the training of large brain models on EEG data will transform the way we will use EEG data in the future.\tBeing able to essentially &quot;re-construct&quot; the inner dialogue or visual tapestry within an individual brain is certainly within reach. I think that over the next 100 years we will be able to facilitate new and immersive forms of communicating our ideas and dreams to others. I also think that most brain disorders will be treated using EEG-guided &quot;electroceuticals&quot; instead of pharmaceuticals.\tYes, it is inevitable that the technologies used to record electrical activity in the brain will continue to evolve and may well be monitored in some other manner that will not be called &quot;EEG&quot;. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI like the idea of seeing EEG as a window through the mind. Still as highly blurred as it is, it has been key for understanding how our brain works. To me, the major breakthrough is clinical diagnosis, with epilepsy diagnostic leading the list. Understanding of sleep stages is another major breakthrough. And I also see as very relevant the use of EEG in studies about consciousness (with or without anesthesia) and free-will (such as the Libet experiments). \t\tTo me, the biggest risk of current EEG in research, clinical or commercial uses is misinterpretation of the results due to noise, artifacts and/or excessive manipulation of the signals (error propagation).\tCurrent efforts to understand how the brain encodes and processes the information, using mostly intracranial EEG (and likely in animal studies), can lead to a major breakthrough for the humanity. Also, consciousness and free-will EEG studies could provide groundbreaking insights to philosophical questions that have not evolved significantly since Greek times. Finally, EEG can play an important role in current efforts, although too little and preliminary for now, for increasing longevity and significantly extending healthy lifespan: brain criopreservation and revival, brain transplant, understanding of brain death process, and consciousness migration (this latter is science fiction for now ;-)).\tI don&#x27;t see many innovations for scalp EEG in the near future. The greatest innovations should come from intracranial EEG, either in humans or in animals.\tI expect that in 100 years we will be close to migrating our consciousness from our primitive brains to artificial ones that will last longer staying healthy. Maybe that&#x27;s too optimistic, but at least an earlier technology of cellular rejuvenation should be available in the next 100 years. In that context, EEG will provide major insights to determine if the brain actually gets younger or not, based on EEG biomarkers for aging.\tNot really, I do not see another technology fully replacing EEG. Intracranial EEG might become safer and less invasive enough to replace scalp EEG.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI believe that a good lier will allways be able to produce normal EEG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSleep alterations and epilepsy diagnosis\t\tNo risk, commercial applications are limited by the unavoidable mismatch between the kind of data and its quality in non-laboratory settings\tNon-sinusoidal oscillations, non stationarity of rhythms, non-linear state-dependency of input processing, temporal encoding/decoding approaches\tnot much, except for a further drop in prices\tnot much.

Biggest risk is low quality EEG data. More needs to be done to improve quality of EEG data acquisition. Also good data should be freely available in anon unused format. It would be incredible if in the future the U.K. had a cross-sectional and longitudinal control database which could be utilised in any scientific research project. \tI think background resting state EEG will and deeper analysis or \u201cnormal\u201d cortical oscillations might provide more information about health and disease than previously first thought. I think this may be particularly the case as the beginning and end of the life span.

EEGLab bringing the data structure and routines for advanced analysis to the masses\t\tFor the medical field, inertia is a big one.  It&#x27;s hard to try out new advancements without a full clinical trial.  For research, blind acceptance of analysis outcomes is a barrier - people often move forward with findings without critically assessing their viability.  That&#x27;s somewhat inevitable in research though.\tAnything that would allow fully compiled stimulus presentation and data analysis with existing hardware infrastructures would be huge.  Think of applying an auditory oddball and analyzing the data of a patient with clinical leads.

They lead to various use/applications such as seizure diagnosis, monitoring cognitive state (e.g., using P300, Error-related potential, brain-to-brain synchrony), mind-based controls (using SSVEP, motor imagery, and so on). They do not only impact our society in medical domains and potentially better user interface, but also help us locate the brain regions that are responsible for certain functions.\t\tTrade-off between signal quality and comfortableness is the biggest barriers. Although nowadays we have devices, such as dry electrodes, that are easier to setup, their signal quality and comfortableness are usually lower compared to traditional setup that generally no one would use outside of essential research or clinical uses.  Signal stability is another barrier. For example, the impedance is usually different every setup and may degrade over time. Even running the same protocol, one could observe different bias or distortions in signals, such as spectrum, over different setups. For post or offline analysis, it is maybe less an issue, but for real time analysis, it could lead to unreliable results due to signal inconsistency. As far as I know, there is easy and quick way to calibrate and compensate.\tIf EEG here does not limit to surface EEG, I would consider decoding of inner speech/audio could lead to major breakthroughs. Assuming it can work well, it can serve as a critical tool for communicating with people in vegetative states. Further, if the development can also apply to non-invasive EEG, this has a great potential to shape person-to-person communication.\tBetter signal acquisition devices. This increases the willingness of people to wear EEG devices and allows more evaluation in real-life scenarios. This helps to collect data that are scarce and hard to collect in laboratory environments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe technology is likely ready, but the difficulty of getting access to work with those individuals can largely slow down this direction.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt can happen, but it may change over time and should be application specific.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tActive neurofeedback, ERP profiling, machine learning for better information analysis\t\tData quality Variability in measurement methods\tMachine learning Source space reconstruction\tBCI Sleep improvement Cognitive state neurofeedback\t\tYes Hopefully other future technologies will transcend EEG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI expect other tech does this more than EEG in future\t\t\thttps://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=vuFq-BCD1ogC&amp;citation_for_view=vuFq-BCD1ogC:W7OEmFMy1HYC\t\t\thttps://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=vuFq-BCD1ogC&amp;citation_for_view=vuFq-BCD1ogC:W7OEmFMy1HYC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEG\tEEG recording technology vastly improved.  Development of MEG technology brought mathematical physicists to the larger field of EMEG/MEEG which greatly impacted theoretical underpinnings of EEG.  Development of structural MRI enabled the construction of realistic volume conductor models of the head.  High-density EEG (128- and 256-channel recordings).  Biomedical engineers brought advanced signal processing into the field.  EEG analysis software packages embody the above methodologies and enable a wide spectrum of human brain researchers to pursue substantive knowledge.  In particular, scholars from outside of traditional health science fields (such as philosophy and music) have a relatively low barrier to entry; and they bring fresh perspectives to the EEG field.\tComputational Psychiatry\tPopulation results may not apply to individuals due to high inter-individual variability.  Intra-individual variability is another factor: An EEG sample at time t may not represent an individual&#x27;s EEG characteristics at other times.\tAbility to construct highly individualized brain models that can simulate a person&#x27;s own EEG could help to realize the aspiration of personalized medicine in the areas of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatry.\tAbility to construct well-individualized 4D (space-time) excitatory-inhibitory models of EEG neurodynamics in local brain areas and globally throughout the brain.  This would enable estimation of biophysically meaningful parameters (biomarkers) that go beyond phenomenological descriptions.  For example, estimation of parameters that reflect excitatory-inhibitory balance regionally and inter-regionally could permit early detection of Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.  I also expect that EEG and MEG technologies will combine to provide more complete and more accurate estimates of such biomarker parameters.\tThe BRAIN Initiative area of Theory, Modeling, and Statistics may come closer to  deep and unified understanding of biology-physics-mind in a way that connects with the &quot;thin slice&quot; of EEG phenomena.  Beyond real world applications, this hopefully could provide insights into our human &quot;natural intelligence&quot; (NI) that can help us to appreciate ourselves as creatures with dignity quite different from AI-based creatures.  AI seems poised to help us understand NI; and it is already being applied to help us understand individual EEG phenomena.\tThis is hard to predict.  OPM technology could revolutionize MEG; but EEG and MEG will always be better together.  Could MRI technology advance to detect neuroelectric activity?

Then there has been breakthrough in terms of science: the P300, somatosensory BCI, sleep stages, and epilepsy detection.\t\tThe biggest barrier is the cost of multi-channel EEG systems. You cannot do EEG research (EEG source localization) with less than 64 channels, yet these systems remain expensive.  Another barrier is the noise, and difficulty to pin point brain sources because of the inherent imprecision of source localization techniques. \tThe recent dry MEG systems could lead to major breakthroughs if they allow for less noise and better source localization.\tEEG has not changed much in 100 years. I do not expect major changes to EEG technology in the next 10 years. Major changes could involve cheaper multi-channel systems and systems integrated into caps. \tMaybe the advance of joint iEEG and EEG could lead to a better understanding of the origin of the EEG signal. Also, I believe that coupled with other techniques (fNIRS, dry MEG), one could gain additional insight. I do not expect major breakthrough, but instead a long road to slowly improving the signal quality and its interpretability.\tEEG for sleep stages might become redundant with the recording of peripheral measures (eye movements, heart rate).\t24-hour monitoring of EEG in the real world will unlock new types of studies.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tERPs are byproducts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDeep Learning Methods\tQEEG-Biofeedback\tThere are several, clinical neurophysiological, markers, source localization procedures, brain connectivity, neurohysiologial-plasticity properties of the brain (I&#x27;ve always referred to them as Neurophysiological Plasticity).\t\tTo make more affordable and reliable the HD-QEEG interfaces such as 128, 256 or 512 channes interfaces.

These developments have led to a greater understanding of brain functioning in typically and atypically developing individuals.  EEG research has specifically led to the discovery of various event-related components, and have shown that these ERPs relate to specific attentional and cognitive processes, and even can predict behavior.  EEG measurements can be used in a clinical setting to predict disease or pathologies, but also to monitor recovery or rehabilitation success.\t\tResearch: easy of montage, lack of spatial precision  Clinic: difficulties of studying populations that have severe attentional and behavioral disturbances (and therefore move a lot).

The lack of common methodologies to make comparable the results from different settings. A common atlas to compare the results of studies using EEG source analysis   Clinical: more training for the staff of clinical settings to apply the technique and understand it.  Commercial: I am not very clear about this part. It depends of the market of neurophysiologists or practitioners interested in the equipments. Besides, the market in Low-Middle Income countries could be huge, but if the prices are very high or the technology the companies offer are not user-friendly enough, the expansion of the EEG technology would be restricted to high income countries, where the other, extra expensive, neuroimaging techniques are more available, are more trendy for neurologists and brain research in general.  the EEG is cheap, non invasive, easy to manage and exploit, but this technology needs better infrastructure and market politics to expand. \tIn my opinion two different developments can lead to major breakthroughs. One is the BCI complete line of research, helping to translate brain electrical signals in effective action according to the new technologies which can produce devices more and more sophisticated including the nanotechnology. The second, is the possibility to build multinational normative EEG parameters, not only in the topography, also in the tomographic space, which can provide the immediate comparison of one individual with the expected brain electrical development. And the possibility to include not only the healthy controls, also sample of patients, with the deviation from the normality. \t- better electrodes or sensors, example: dry electrodes with resistance to movement and other physical interferences - the remote recordings  \t\t\t\t0\tsoon\t5\t3\t2\t3\t5\t2\t3\t2\t0\t3\t3\t4\t4\t3\t3\t2\t3\t5\t5\t5\t5\t5\t\t10\t3\t6\t4\t4\t6\t4\t3\t4\t4\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEG\tSleep stating, characterization encephalopathies and epileptiform activity, the identification and characterization of ERP components (MMN, P3, N4, readiness potentials, etc.), the development of time-frequency analysis, theoretical and empirical developments related to oscillatory processes and the &quot;binding by synchrony hypothesis,&quot; emerging applications of brain-computer interfaces.\t\tThe biggest barriers are related to the cost and time-intensiveness of collecting high-density, high-SNR data at scale. \timproving brain computer interfaces\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnderstanding sleep and sleep disorders Understanding the timing of brain processes related to cognition Understanding mechanisms of cognition (e.g., attention related processes)\t\tCost, ease of use, spatial resolution\tI think the next major breakthroughs will not be in EEG but in adjacent technologies such as MEG \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLongterm EEG\t\tdiagnosis and differential diagnosis of seizures sleep medicine and stages coma and brain death\t\ttime consuming uncomfortable for patients inadequate payment by insurance agencies\tambulatory long term EEG with reduced channels\tno idea\tno idea\tno\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(1) the use of EEG measures to diagnose sleep disorders, epilepsy, brain death, and to monitor states of alertness, aiding in personalized treatment strategies (2) the use of intracranial EEG to define the functional specialization of neurons, e.g. discovery of receptive fields of single neurons in the visual cortex by Hubel and Wiesel, revolutionizing our understanding of visual processing (3) the discovery of ERPs and their associations with cognitive and affective processing, providing valuable insights into how the brain responds to and processes various stimuli (4) the use of the EEG measures as variables reflecting individual differences (in norm and psychopathology), enhancing our understanding of neurodiversity (5) the use of EEG in clinical brain\u2013computer interfaces which allow individuals with paralysis to control assistive devices, enhancing their quality of life  \t\t(1) overly sophisticated analyses - it&#x27;s essential to strike a balance between the sophistication of signal processing methods and their interpretability. Opting for more transparent and comprehensible analysis techniques, even if they are less complex, can often yield more accessible and practical outcomes, fostering a better understanding of EEG data and its implications for brain function and clinical applications  (2) limited reliability and accuracy of some EEG measures as diagnostic tools for individual assessments - e.g., while ERPs hold promise in understanding group-level differences associated with certain disorders like OCD, their reliability and accuracy as sole diagnostic tools for individual assessments is limited. Integration with other diagnostic measures and clinical assessments is still necessary to improve their utility in individual diagnosis within psychiatric contexts.  (3) lack of standardized protocols in EEG-based scientific research - the use of different analysis techniques can hinder reproducibility of findings. Establishing universal standards could improve reliability and comparability of results.

In the clinical context, barriers include the technical expertise required to record and process the data and the knowledge required to interpret outcomes.  \tWearable, subtle, confortable &quot;second-skin&quot; style recording electrodes are needed to allow for real-world recording over longer period of time.\tSecond-skin style recording electrodes.\tNo idea.\tNo\t\t55\t0\t10\t44\t30\t5\t10\t50\t10\t7\t0\t10\t0\t10\t0\t5\t5\t0\t40\t75\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI would highlight two breakthroughs. First would be the plan and analyses of the first ERPs in the 1930s. Then, I would say it would be the usage of EEG signals in BCI systems around the 2000s\t\tFor research is the variety of methods and lack of standards on several aspects of the EEG analyses that may hinder the reproducibility of findings, together with the small sample sizes we are still using. For clinical and commercial usage, I will say the barrier is the high inter-individual variety and the lack of understanding of the factors behind them for their use in individuals. In that regard, the risk is its misuse for &quot;selling&quot; products and the subsequent loss of trust on the technique by the general public.\tOf course, registered reports and large multicenter studies and initiatives are on of those steps we do as a community.  Another interesting effort from my perspective is trying to link the EEG with other rythmic activities and processes in the human body and the environment. It will probably help us better understand why the brain is using such mechanism for computation.\tThe usage of EEG active electrodes aided by AI to filter out noise and artifactual sources. I think that AI will try to spread to any potential usage, and soon we may see it implemented on EEG recording equipment. It could provide researchers with cleaner data and help them adjust the number of trials and the length of the sessions in real-time based on the amount and quality of the data gathered. It may, however, impede new breakthroughs as the AI will be based on what has been previously considered noise, which will some how predispose researchers to avoid exploring other parameters of the data.\tI don&#x27;t know, but probably most EEG researchers have the dream of EEG being widely used in everyday living. With lighter and durable equipments that individuals will use as they do now with the activity bracelets and watches. That will provide lots of information to be analised and explored.\tI don&#x27;t think so, probably some reformulation and integration with other techniques will be forced and is likely to occur. But I think most of the techniques has unique characteristics that will be preserved and make them different (even if slightly) from other techniques. Only combination, which will be much easier in the future, would provide a more complete picture.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdigital filter, online processing, machine learning\t\tethic concern and myth of getting all the human thought\tcomfortable portable device.\tReal time decoding in real life\tdirect feedback to the brain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStudying human mental processing was not very much direct before the existence of the EEG technique. EEG has equipped us a means to directly study human mind through brain&#x27;s electrophysiological responses. The fields most benefitted from this include clinical (assessment, diagnosis, brain functioning in patients), cognitive (brain functioning in healthy population), human-environment interaction vi brain signals (BCI and neurofeedback, leading to some promising applications such as device control using EEG). It is going to be a long list if we should list all the breakthroughs. In short, it is a window into the functioning brain.\t\tStill quite limited information present in surface EEG recordings. This greatly limits the result interpretability and application accuracy.\tPrediction and enhancement of human behaviour with EEG data and deep learning.\tBetter methods for a much more thorough understanding of EEG activities as an integrated system of various signals, instead of individual ERP components or frequency bands.\tPrecise control of environment/devices using EEG.

The neuron does not have sole access to the throne any more.  I think the results we have achieved using the EEG have reflected the potential for understanding complex systems more generally from the macroscale, and that the macroscale is amenable to control (as seen through BCI where alpha rhythms are modulated to select a letter and so on). This means other complex systems likely reflect similar properties - such as societies.\t\tOne barrier to use is the cost associated with deploying EEG - if caps and recording was cheaper then a lot more people would be playing with EEG and there would be huge progress. This is steadily happening.   The other barrier is good dry electrodes for low-noise EEG recordings.   And yet another is the need to implement source localization for so many studies - for example - the use of EEG as a biomarker doesn&#x27;t necessitate source localization. Source localization tends to only make it harder to replicate any individual study (this is of course my own speculation - there&#x27;s no study I know of that actually makes this case but given all the little knobs you can turn and buttons you can press when doing source localization, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this were true).  I think the risks around regular everyday EEG-use come around to ethical risks - if the macroscale truly imposes constraints on the microscale, and the EEG gives us access to the macroscale and the capacity to alter it then how long before capitalism uses this technology in service of a profit motive? \tI think closed-loop experiments where sensory stimulation is deployed relative to rhythms detected from EEGs could be a major breakthrough for cognitive function in the next couple of decades. \tWe don&#x27;t do much recordings from the subcortex because of how hard it is but I think that is coming - we will increasingly innovate ways to record from the subcortex (going inside the nose/mouth perhaps?).   As I already said - closed-loop sensory stimulation linked to brain rhythms measured by EEG is going to be huge I think, unless we come up with another way to measure macroscale electrophysiology within the next decade. \tI have spoken to this in the next question - I think EEG will be redundant in 100 years - though the tools we build to analyze it, what we understand from EEG about rhythms till then and help control behavior based on it will continue to be useful. \tEEG is useful but only until we find a tool that is less noisy and less susceptible to muscle artifact. The new recording tools that depend on nanotechnology will be interesting to watch but what we really need are ways to record the macroscale from inside the cortex without needing surgery - I suspect we will have that in the next 100 years (assuming everything doesn&#x27;t collapse). \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Sample size  Bad data collection  No NIH mandated pipelines  No common bank fr cutting edge measures  Bias against eeg from other brain imaging  Lack of awareness about validity of source estimtion  Lack of multimodal brain models  \t\tLong term easy wearability with great signal  Nanomethods for clean signals / bettet sensors/caps  Growing multisite  movement  More eeg+other modalities  More mature EEG researchers moving into decision making roles among funders and departments.

Neurometrics. The work of Roy John and colleagues started the era of analysis of EEG using computers, allowing for a large number of new methods being used to both characterize and model the EEG data. This brought a huge impact on clinical applications, child and newborn screening applications, etc. Cognitive Neuroscience grew as a major field when EEG responses could also be quantified in controlled experiments, e.g. Evoked potentials, PCA, ICA, artifact correction, electrophysiological source imaging.  - Neuronal mass models for explaining EEG dynamics. Despite some misleading attempts to claim a chaotic behavior of the EEG, the appearance of models that mimic the EEG dynamics, opened a big space for new insights on the possible physiological phenomena originating EEG. This also brought a large number of new ways of extract information from the EEG using time series analysis, chaos, and probabilistic methods. Less important regarding clinical applications. - EEG-fMRI conjoint recordings. This allowed to bring back the importance of the high temporal resolution when the MRI-based neuroimages started to gain large popularity. The complementarity of EEG and all other neuroimaging techniques, makes it to be considered as a valued data that contains relevant information about brain functioning. Multimodality has been later extended (e.g. EEG-MEG, EEG-fNIRS). - EEG-based Neurofeedback. I include here the BCI applications as part of neurofeedback as this is a natural mechanism for the brain to learn how to control any system once it has the proper information to evaluate/adjust the relationship between action and response. Despite clinical applications has not been completely successful, the finding that the brain can adjust itself using feedback of its activity or that EEG signals can be used for interacting with external technology, created a new point of view about the importance of the information contained in the EEG. - Hyperscanning EEG. Although still very young, there are enough evidence that suggest that the synchronization of EEG data among interacting subjects is not only real, but underlies many aspects of the human social behavior. This will probably be able to show that many of the high-level socio-psychological behavior (e.g. ability to learn in a classroom, empathy, engagement in psychotherapy, success in relationships or in working teams) might also be codified in the (hyperscanning) EEG signals, which therefore might be used to predict such behavior.  \t\t- Research: a big barrier is the lack of a ground truth to relate the EEG signals with a more direct measurement of the \u201cbrain state\u201d. For instance, if tMS or another technique allows to \u201cimpose\u201d the source of a measured EEG, then this would be of major importance to test the source localization methods. - Clinical: The large variability across subjects for the current settings, still make it very slow to standardize applications and generalize the use of novel developments in EEG. \t- Measuring EEG during Magnetic or Electrical stimulation that can gives a ground truth about the sources. - Predicting epileptic seizures and other pathologies with enough time to treat the patient beforehand.  - Finding reliable neurofeedback applications that allow patients to train their brains in order to avoid psychological or psychiatric disorders. - Developing EEG-based AI to allow predict the diagnosis or prognosis of different pathologies such as cognitive decline, or learning disorders in children. \t- Neuromanagement and Neurotherapy. Using hyperscanning to create working teams that engage optimally with each other. EEG signals in an interaction protocol might help to decide who can be member of the same creative team or not. The same technology could be used by psychiatrics or psychoanalysts to evaluate the level of engagement of psychiatric patients with the treatment when this treatment is more based on psychological therapy. - Diagnosis of pathologies with EEG-based AI. Although 10 years is not much to create the huge databases needed to find the relevant patterns, there might be some AI applications to predict epileptic seizures, the level of sleep, the depth of anesthesia, learning disorders, autism, etc. \t- Neuromarketing. Creation of commercial content that is directed to each subject taking into account the individual inclination for a particular product or type of products according to the patterns contained in the EEG while using that product. - Neuroemotion. Creation of technology that evaluates the emotional state through EEG and can even be linked to a neural stimulator to intervene in pathological states.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElectronics devices.

This has the potential to institute a theory-experiment interplay as in fields such as physics, to the benefit of both sides, with more being extracted from data and the possibility of generating new types of hypotheses and solving previously intractable problems. Unfortunately, the lack of mathematical training of most experimentalists/clinicians is hampering the full benefit of these advances from being realized. Notably, as the 100th anniversary of Berger&#x27;s first recording approaches, the first unified, quantitative theory of the alpha, mu, and tau rhythms, and their second harmonics is nearing publication.\t\tNo comment.\tA promising advance (I won&#x27;t call it a breakthrough) is the rapid convergence of theory and experiment mentioned above.\tAutomated characterization and analysis will be more common and perhaps the existing ones will be taken up more widely - e.g., for inference of physiological parameters, sleep state, etc.\tNo comment.\tNo comment. \tI predict that, unless neuroscience adopts the standard theory-experiment interplay that applies across more established branches of science (physics, chemistry, engineering, applied mathematics), progress will be much slower and more circumscribed than would otherwise be the case.

Current methods for EEG soruce localization are insufficient and inaccurate. EEG devices need a jump of quality to be more specific and more accurate.\tAI is producing a dramatic change in the EEG use. There are currently tools which are able to accurately detect artifacts, recognize activity associated to different disorders, detect emotional states, and others.\tWireless, invisible, highly portable, systems that allow to implement thought based devices that execute what is in my mind, like automatic writing, speech production, neural rehabilitation, and many more.\tNon invasive devices to measure the electrical brain activity at the neurons.

That EEG is used as a key aspect of detection and diagnosis of, for example, seizure disorders and sleep disorders is a testament to the impact it has had in the broader society.   In terms of research, several key developments stand out, perhaps most notably the access it provides for studying healthy cognition with concurrent brain recordings - long before we had other methods for doing so. In this work, the development of systematized task procedures and event-related potential (ERP) paradigms was pivotal for developing an early understanding of how the brain reacts to stimuli and different task contexts. Beyond this, the continuing development and application of frequency and time-frequency domain methods for quantifying activity measured by EEG has been impactful for providing ways to measure, discuss, and interpret neural features that can be related to cognitive phenomena. Much of our current ideas about how patterns of activity relate to cognition is owed to the work from EEG establishing basic properties and dynamics of neural signals including ERPs and neural oscillations. \t\tIn both research and clinical contexts, I think one of the key current barriers is on the topic of training and developments for the technical aspects of analyzing and interpreting EEG data, especially in the changing face of research whereby projects are often moving towards larger datasets analyzed with increasingly automated tools and machine learning algorithms. While these developments are potentially highly impactful, we need to ensure that we develop and apply well posed methods that estimate interpretable features - which is a challenge in the context of training in research that often underemphasizes robust pedagogy on technical topics including signal processing, coding, and critical analysis of our methods, as well as the need to balance (in both research and clinical contexts) that approaches are both accessible and robust. Related to this, despite the relative ease of collecting EEG data (or perhaps because of it), there is a relative lack of the adoption and proliferation of good open-science and meta-science projects (for example using structured data formats, and having commonly used shared data repositories) that prohibit the kind of curation and large-scale analysis that could broaden our understanding of EEG data.  In commercial settings, I think the biggest risks relate to the incentive structures that promote over-stated and unscrupulous claims for the purpose of commercial gain, that ultimately risk tarnishing the reputation of things we can actually do with EEG. While there has been useful development in terms of hardware, many of the commercial applications (eg. increasing user focus) are not well demonstrated or validated. \tI think there is great promise in the continued development of cheap, robust, and mobile hardware that can be used in contexts in which expensive recordings devices are prohibitive - including for research purposes whereby large scale recordings could provide vital information at scale, across often ignored populations, as well the clinical possibilities of using cheap &amp; mobile EEG, when appropriate, to assist with diagnoses and triage. If such developments could be paired with more robust data curation practices and robust, effective analysis tools, we could productively leverage the large amount of data which is technically available, but practically often impossible to connect together.   It is also a deeply uncritical analysis to position ChatGPT as a &quot;major breakthrough&quot; without context or nuance - key components of it&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough&quot; include it being a model with clearly demonstrated bias and potential for harm, a truly ludicrous environmental footprint, and a tool for the rampant proliferation of spam and misinformation. If this is the model of &quot;breakthrough&quot; that is being used, our goal should in fact be to avoid pursuing such dangerous &quot;developments&quot;.\tThe most productive &quot;innovations&quot; would be to learn from other areas, such as in imaging, and have the field fully engage in the kind of community standards and shared robust infrastructure that would allow for scaling our datasets and analyses. \tI think there is a possibility of having recording setups in which cheap, robust, perhaps wireless recording electrodes could be created and used for ongoing recordings of people in everyday life (if such a system was minimally annoying to have people wear in everyday contexts), and we could emerge into a context of having large data, collected over time, that could be used for understanding the ongoing dynamics and variability of brain activity (within and across people) as well as having possible clinical applications (detection of aberrant events, etc). \tIt will be interesting to follow the developments of OPMs, and if they offer a useful and relevant alternative to at least some applications of EEG.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSingle units\tBeing able to track events as they evolve in time; brain-machine interface\t\tSpatial resolution, noisy signal (hard to work on single trials)\tbrain machine interfaces, machine learning\tdecoding the content of consciousness and thought from EEG signal\tI don&#x27;t think it would be serious of me to answer\tNot that I can think of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsEEG\tImpact on society definitely epilepsy.\t\tTheoretical understanding of EEG Analysis techniques\tInta-aural EEG Real-time analysis \tBMI\tLow cost wearable  MEG combined with EEG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tScientist\t\t\t\t\tFFT, Loreta, ICA, ERP.

Use of EEG for understanding neural bases of neuropsychiatric disorders. \t\tOverstating results, particularly for commercial purposes. EEG is a powerful technique with many important clinical and research applications, however, as a researcher in this space, it is frustrating to see false or exaggerated claims about its use. This is perhaps most prevalent in the area of diagnostic/clinical &#x27;biomarkers&#x27; where group-level findings are often (incorrectly) extrapolated to single individuals/patients. There are obviously some exceptions, e.g., epilepsy, where EEG can serve as a highly accurate diagnostic tool, however, this is not the case in other areas, e.g., psychiatry. \tI think the combination of EEG with machine learning, as it continues to evolve, could see very important breakthroughs in the diagnostic space. I think this might be particularly powerful when these ML pipelines are combined with (very) large public datasets. \tI think dry/gel-free electrode technology could be an important advancement to significantly reduce set-up times whilst maintaining signal quality. This could also benefit higher density electrode montages. I also think automated cleaning pipelines will be of significant benefit. \tI&#x27;m not sure if EEG will still exist in 100 years! However, I think significantly improved spatial resolution will be essential for EEG to advance/stay relevant in the long-term. Overcoming volume conduction effects, for instance, will be required, whether this is achieved using advanced EEG tehcnologies, or using advances in e.g., OP-MEG etc. \tI think it will be essential for EEG to make significant improvements in spatial resolution (including at the sub-cortical level) to stay relevant long-term. \t\tIt can already do this for seizures!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScalp eeg technology can be used in constructing detailed maps of brain activity especially in high frequency ( similar to biofeedback technic ) to asess if you are ready to learn  for example maths at the moment. If not then you need to take a short session of meditation . So I think eeg will be used as a technic of monitoring and training  the concentration, results of psychiatric treatment. In my opinion it may be the easiest method to monitor quantuum effects in a brain directly in the nearest future but the scalp eeg technic must be developed more.\tAs I mentioned  the quantuum effects in the brain tissue should be the main direction for neurosciences to develope. I think these effects enable us to synchronize brain activity( like in meditation )and control mental and  non- mental processes. So when we are able to monitor it  by more developed eeg then everybody will have his own small EEG apparatus to train and monitor. On the base the other machines ,controlled by our brain activity , will be invented.\tI think EEG technic is the easiest and the cheapest way to get some information about the brain electrical activity. Other functional methods need very complicated machines in large sizes. So it will not be possible to replace EEG in the nearest future.

These two innovations that improved strength of the signal also contributed to better decoding of information by application of machine learning algorithms that in turn are useful in cognitive neuroscience. The extend of how much machine learning will contribute in understanding of human brain is yet unclear to me. What is the most useful breakthrough in my opinion is that we can use short latency ERPs to test hearing in newborns. Early detection of hearing loss has major impact on children&#x27;s future. There is no other technique that is so quick, cheap, and effective as this one.\t\tICA helped to increase the signal but it is still far from the quality of iEEG. We still need a lot of trials.

New and affordable technologies are needed.  Secondly, EEG requests multidisciplinary knowledge. This exceeds one scientist&#x27;s and even a group of scientists&#x27; from similar fields capabilities. Thus, without a multidisciplinary team, EEG researches and other usages become deficit and erroneous.    Another issue is non-standardization and lack of reporting of procedures and steps of EEG application and statistical analysis. This leads to intentional and/or unintentional research biases and bring EEG studies into question.   \tInternational collaborations especially in behavioural neuroscience is the most promising and personally exciting current efforts I think. Because, methodological inconsistencies and errors are important than theoritical developments.     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe entire initial development of EEG, in which there could be a functional window of activity for a set of neurons, where the cerebral state could be objectively measured and correlated with behavior, was a significant initial leap in the use of EEG in neuroscience  In recent decades, following the emergence of functional magnetic resonance imaging, EEG was initially perceived as a somewhat imprecise tool for measuring functional activity. However, over the years, it has gained more prominence, emphasizing its unique capability to capture the temporal dynamics of functional activity. It has proven to be a valuable tool, particularly when complemented with techniques based on magnetic resonance. Additionally, the complementary use of stimulation techniques provides unique information that cannot be extracted from functional resonance alone, specifically the precise oscillatory activity related to a particular cerebral process. Undoubtedly, the challenge in the coming years will be to develop with greater precision and replicability the combined use of functional resonance and brain stimulation techniques to delve into understanding brain mechanisms.\t\tI believe the most important aspect is to work towards facilitating respectful and user-friendly utilization. Furthermore, findings and analyses in basic research should be translatable to clinical or commercial applications, employing clear procedures and algorithms that are easy to implement, understand, and replicable across various contexts.\t I believe a pivotal turning point in the development of EEG is its combined use with stimulation tools. The information provided by EEG is unique, and the opportunity to base therapies on this information for the development of physiology-based treatments could be a breakthrough in the evolution of therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.\tThe most important aspect is the clear development of protocols and algorithms that enable straightforward and replicable concurrent use of EEG along with magnetic resonance imaging and brain stimulation.\tWhile it is an extremely challenging question, leading us more towards imagination than science, based on my previous response, I would think that a change in the technical aspect should focus on the combination of other techniques, whether in stimulation or imaging. The primary long-term objective should be the precise localization of brain activity, independent of individual circumstances such as skull variations or other personal variables. To achieve this, envisioning a significant technical shift is necessary, one that not only involves improving measurement electrodes but also entails a combination of certain measurement and intervention elements, as well as the measurement of other aspects, such as imaging or other relevant parameters.\tno\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome marker only \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh-definition EEG - an affordable, simple and practical way to look at source-based connectivity at the point of care.\t\tCost and practicality - e.g. gel based EEG gives much better signal but difficult to use in children - do not want to sit still for an hour. \tImproved accuracy of saline HD-EEG nets and better processing pipelines. \tWidely available brain computer interfaces, closed loop electrical stimulation.

After decades of research, the application of EEG in most clinical settings remains the old methods of measuring 10-20 system, gluing electrodes, and requiring a neurologist to analyze the data. \tCommoditization of BCI with focus on video games and AR/VR has had tremendous breakthroughs on simplifying the physical application of the sensors and on signal processing and analysis. I am hopeful that these will then be applied to clinical settings. \tExpect a wider adoption In hospital and prehospital settings as the signal analysis and physical application is simplified.

Initially aiding paralyzed individuals in communication, they now empower users to control prosthetics, computers, and more with thought. Integration with machine learning has enhanced accuracy, while non-invasive methods like EEG broaden applications such as neuroergonomics. These advances offer increased autonomy for the disabled but also introduce ethical concerns about human augmentation, reshaping our relationship with technology. \t\tEEG, a powerful tool for tracking brain activity, confronts significant hurdles in both research and industrial arenas. The data it yields is intricate, leading to challenges in interpretation and broad generalizations. Each individual&#x27;s brain activity can manifest uniquely, thus making overarching conclusions tough. Moreover, EEG is highly susceptible to artifacts from sources like muscle movements or electrical interference, further muddying the waters. Deciphering genuine neural signals from such noise necessitates expertise, making effective EEG use both an art and science.\tIn industrial and natural settings, wearable EEG technologies will eventually become a game-changer. These devices enable data collection in real-world environments, enhancing ecological validity. Advanced algorithms, especially with new IA approaches including generative IA, will continue to streamline data analysis, even amidst real-world noise and artifacts. The rise of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in industries, powered by EEG, promises improved human-machine interactions. These developments, combined with real-time processing, should greatly amplify EEG&#x27;s impact in industrial tasks.\tIn the next decade, neuroergonomics will benefit from EEG advancements like Advanced Signal Processing, harnessing AI to refine noise reduction and enhance real-time brain state detection. Integration with other systems, like fNIRS, will meld EEG&#x27;s temporal precision with fNIRS&#x27;s spatial accuracy, offering a richer brain activity panorama. Furthermore, combined EEG-eye tracking systems will elucidate links between in-task visual attention and neural activity. These innovations promise more nuanced, real-time insights into human-machine interactions in diverse work and authentic environments.\tOver the next 100 years, the marriage of quantum computing with EEG is expected to birth ultra-high resolution systems, revealing intricate neural details during natural, authentic tasks. This quantum-fueled granularity will unmask nuanced cognitive processes as they unfold in real-world settings, transcending current laboratory constraints. Such advancements will redefine our understanding of brain-behavior relationships, paving the way for more effective interventions, optimized learning environments, and truly adaptive technological interfaces aligned with innate human neural rhythms.\tDifficult to answer this one. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsensory neuroscience\t\tPSG\t1.

This has then been adapted and expanded to closed-loop, intracranial EEG neurostimulation for epilepsy, with promising applications in other clinical domains as well. In addition, EEG is widely used in nearly every modern hospital in the world to test the fidelity of the auditory system in newborn babies, via the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP).\t\tThe biggest barrier to further enhance and improve how EEG is used is our lack of understanding regarding the physiological origins of common EEG signal features: ERPs, oscillations, and aperiodic activity.\tBridging the systems neuroscience world to scalp EEG through the use of large-scale invasive recording systems\u2014such as neuropixels\u2014with simultaneous single-unit recording and scalp EEG, promises to help us understand the basic physiological generators of EEG signals of interest.\tI except the more wide-scale adoption of consumer-level EEG, through their incorporation into things like in-ear earbuds and so on, will lead to another boom in EEG research. In conjunction with other consumer wearable devices, I expect to see a lot more research on brain-body interactions, such as the effects of autonomic signals (ECG, respiration) on neural functioning and cognition.\tWhile there are fundamental mathematical constraints on the ability to localize EEG signals to specific sources, I expect that real-time EEG systems that can take signals from devices and rapidly clean them of non-EEG artifacts will provide a huge boon to clinical use.\tPerhaps via mobile MEG, but I feel like the ease with which EEG can be incorporated into other everyday objects (earbuds, sunglasses) will continue to keep it relevant.\t\tseizures yes, tumors not yet\t\tAs gimmicks, like 3D movies, but never widely-adopted\t\t\t\t\tintracranial EEG yes, EEG no\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe biggest barrier is the low space resolution of the signal\tmachine learning techniques applied to eeg\ti don&#x27;t expect any major develoments  longitudinal studies and medium-lon term monitoring may become relevant, specially if a surge of low-budget low-energy wireless devices continue to become available\t\tif other imaging techniques become cheaper and easy to implement, EEG may become redundant\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresolution of the signal\t\tBMI areas\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tSenior Biotech Industry Researcher\tCommercial Healthcare Organization\tNeuroscience Drug Development\t\t\tMedical applications in monitoring level of consciousness and epileptiform abnormalities.

This technique enables us to establish specific correlations between EEG patterns and cognitive/motor activities. Moreover, the identified EEG patterns can be utilized as biomarkers in practice. \t\tIndividual differences, as highlighted by Steven Luck, account for a significant portion of the variance observed in EEG signals. This factor makes it extremely challenging to generalize an EEG biomarker identified in one set of samples to another specific individual. This hurdle casts a shadow over the future prospects of EEG\u2019s clinical applications.     \tThe decoding of human speech in the brain through invasive brain-computer interfaces (such as the work being done by the Edward Chang lab) would be a major breakthrough in the next decade.\tThe technology of using a minimal number of electrodes to record EEG activity without restricting people&#x27;s speech or movements would be extremely important for neuromarketing and sports science.\tResearch on the underlying mechanisms of inter-brain synchronization may reach a point where hyperscanning techniques can be safely used for speechless communications.\tThe advancement of MEG technology, especially in the realm of portable devices, may render EEG obsolete in certain fields.\tMany of these items are mind-blowing and exceed my imagination.

There have been new techniques, and key findings have been replicated, but I think the state of the field now is comparable to how it was 10 years ago. I&#x27;m not sure what the solution here is; I don&#x27;t think we need new methods, I think we need better theories about brain function and electrical fields that can generate new, insightful, revelatory, and flasifiable hypotheses.\tI get a lot of questions about the impact of AI and deep learning models in neuroscience. So far, I have not seen any good applications of AI in the EEG community, because the decoding applications have not been so much better than existing machine-learning models, and the applications in research have been opaque and difficult to interpret.  As I wrote in the previous comment, I don&#x27;t think there are any new engineering principles or data-handling methods that will lead to a major breakthrough. Instead, I think we need new theories about what the electric fields mean, what they tell us, and how they should behave for different cognitive and behavioral signatures. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not nearly smart enough to come up with these new theories so I am waiting for good news from others ;)\tI would like to see higher-density recordings becoming more commonplace. We already have ~500-channel EEG, and my experience with 256 channels is that there is a lot more information in EEG than one thinks from 64 channels. This trope about the limited spatial information in EEG is a myth that has been perpetuated by old people who didn&#x27;t know how to deal with &amp;gt;16 channels, and most of the field continues to perpetuate that myth for literally no reason other than expediency.\tOof, that&#x27;s tough. I won&#x27;t make predictions that far out.  But looking back 100 years, there are some consistent themes: Berger did (qualitative) spectral and time-frequency analyses, he observed cross-frequency coupling (beta power to alpha phase synchronization), he suggested ERP analyses. I think he would be impressed at our computer analysis technology, but he would recognize most of the analyses we perform as observations he made.\tNot really. EEG is cheap, fast, and easy. We don&#x27;t have any other brain measurement technology like that. I doubt room-temperature MEG will have an acceptable SNR. Maybe fNIRS could be a competitor if the sensors improve.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI think it will be possible for honest people, but liars will be able to train themselves to trick the detector system.\t\t\t\t\t\tlol\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the advent of EEG and its completion of 100 years, we are well aware that the understanding of EEG, its recording equipment, processing, and analysis techniques has shown remarkable advancement. Each advancement in the field is equally important and brings us one step closer to understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms of the brain. In my personal opinion, improvements in brain connectivity estimation techniques have exponentially increased our understanding of brain functions. Examining deviations in these connections with respect to connections in healthy subjects allows us to quantitatively diagnose various mental disorders, which were previously only diagnosed subjectively.  In the field of diagnosis, EEG for the brain is now equivalent to blood tests for other pathological diseases.  Not only this, the study of brain connections and networks has also contributed to targeted treatments of regions through neurofeedback techniques. The same methods can be employed for performance improvement, understanding of BCI, sequential working of the brain, and more.  Through interdisciplinary research, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (including deep learning) have greatly expanded the applications of EEG. Handpicked feature extraction is now being done automatically with great accuracy and reliability, opening the door to more advanced EEG applications.  Clearly, all these advancements are directly impacting our society in a very positive way. Earlier diagnosis, the development of treatments, BCI applications, and an understanding of brain mechanisms for performance improvement are just a few examples of the impact of EEG.  Up until now, I have not witnessed unethical or disturbing uses of EEG, unlike with other advanced technologies. However, in the future, I foresee it as a potential threat to human privacy as we progress in EEG biometric identification, thought-to-text, and the creation of human dreams via EEG.\t\tThe brain is highly dynamic in nature. Despite our ability to identify brain regions through various approaches such as Brodmann areas or lobes and define their functions, a single neuron has the capacity to change its mechanism, thereby significantly affecting the overall function of a specific region. The impact of different stimuli on neurons and their behavior remains largely unknown.  Among the numerous barriers, one of the most significant challenges is maintaining EEG invivo and recording brain signals from deep brain regions without the necessity of source localization, avoiding volume conduction, and achieving a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) with no artifacts while performing routine tasks normally.  Solving this barrier will lead to a significant improvement in all domains, whether it be research, clinical, or commercial. It will enhance result quality, reliability, and confidence.\tI have already explained the interdisciplinary advancements in EEG research. The AI models can now extract robust and reliable features that were previously not possible to obtain via conventional signal processing techniques. The use of AI in diagnosis and perhaps even in devising treatments will greatly impact humankind in a positive way.\tI have also addressed this in my earlier responses. Currently, the biggest challenge is capturing highly dynamic signals from both the scalp and deep brain regions without the use of source localization, free from volume conduction, and without introducing artifacts. This should be done without imposing movement restrictions on subjects, allowing them to engage in their daily routines while recording.  It would also be advantageous if the recording device is inconspicuous, easy to wear, and wireless, with an improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).  Once achieved, this will provide us with genuine information, free from corruption, and undoubtedly enhance our results&#x27; accuracy manyfold, making them applicable in real-world scenarios.\tIn the next 100 years, presuming that we will have perfected our EEG recording devices, I believe we will enter the era of telepathy. Many languages may become obsolete as we develop a universal EEG-based telepathic language. This advancement will enable communication with individuals who do not share our spoken language, allowing us to interact via EEG without the need for words.  Looking further ahead, in the next 100 years, I envision a scenario where all human brains collectively form a vast brain cluster. Individuals will be interconnected through their thoughts recorded as EEG. Each individual brain will be treated as a smaller unit, and an AI-based central processing system will utilize these individual nodes to accomplish larger tasks. While it may sound fictitious, considering the potential of perfect EEG recordings and analysis, this idea doesn&#x27;t seem farfetched.\tNo, the human brain will remain a mystery for us. Not everyone might agree with me, and it doesn&#x27;t sound very scientific, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s the soul that drives our brain and heart. Tapping into the soul still seems impossible. Unless we understand how the soul works, the understanding of the brain will never be perfected.\t Although there are many responses that have already yielded good results, my answers are based on the premise that these methods will provide reliable results with fewer assumptions. Currently, we have to impose numerous constraints on the subject to obtain a decent-quality EEG signal.  As stated in my earlier responses, unless and until we perfect this issue, all the things mentioned here will never gain universal acceptance and cannot be integrated into our daily life routine. I have already indicated two major advancements over the course of the next 200 years. For the first 100 years, the development of an EEG-based telepathic language, and then, the formation of a universal brain cluster after 200 years. This timeframe might change once we overcome the barrier of the EEG recording issue that I mentioned earlier.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA great advance in EEG has been the development of source-localization methods. This is still to be improved, but it makes the EEG spatial resolution closer to other methods, somehow limiting the disadvantage of this technique. Since one of the most important features of brain activity is the timing of fast-paced changes in neural dynamics, EEG is still one of the best (and not intrusive) ways of capturing these dynamics while they&#x27;re happening.\t\tI think that there are no limits to our use of EEG in research, because we scientist are used to act within an ethical frame. In the clinical field, we must be sure that all proposed diagnostic tools using EEG registrations have been scientifically confirmed to be effective before starting to use them, because sometimes people very easily believe they&#x27;ve found &quot;the neuromarker of XXX condition&quot; and try to sell it as the &quot;cutting diagnostic tool&quot; to get attention and success. And, the most important field that needs a regulation, is the commercial one. Business doesn&#x27;t put ethics first, the priority is earning, and most companies have lucrative agendas. Therefore, potencial misuses of EEG capacity of &quot;reading&quot; brain activity might be used to interfere with or obtain important information about customers&#x27; functioning trying to apply machine learning or AI algorithms to get more information than they&#x27;re willing to consciously offer. \tMVPA and similar methodologies can help classify and predict many things that, together with AI applications, might potentially open up a series of unprecedent possibilities close to science fiction movies. BUT (and this is connected to my previous commentary) it is important to put some limits to the development of these applications (especially in the commercial field), otherwise we might be overwhelmed by them and maybe assist to an uncontrolled growth of dangerous or harmful situations that we don&#x27;t want to face in the future.\tI would like to see EEG completely portable without losing resolution and the creation of UIs which allow whoever to instantaneously &quot;interpret&quot; the register without all the preprocessing + analyzing phase. Maybe also the development of nonlinear analyses will be so well established that we will use a combination of current linear and nonlinear knowledge of brain dynamics in a confident way in our normal practice. This would imply knowing exactly how these dynamics occur, so I hope that in 10 years we will have a clear view about that. An important &quot;missing part&quot; in our current application of EEG is the inability of this methodology to give information about what happens at the subcortical level. So, I actually HOPE that in the next 10 years we will have solved this limitation.\tProbably some boundaries about physical world might be broken with applications which boost today&#x27;s BCIs potentials. We don&#x27;t know which consequences this &quot;mental power&quot; will have (if negative or positive, or if, as usual, a mix of positive and negative aspects), but I think it&#x27;s possible on the long run to just &quot;think something&quot; and make it happen in the real world.\tEEG is more improvable to make it portable and increase effectiveness without losing information. Other technologies have the disadvantage to be costly or bulky or invasive, so I don&#x27;t visualize other methods to be advanced MORE than EEG. Just by improving the way we visualize EEG signal (i.e. developing applications that allow to visualize better and easily brain activity while it happens), we can have almost infinite possibilities to understand and explore the brain at work.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHopefully they will be established earlier than 5 years\tHopefully\tHopefully never :D they&#x27;re private\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSocial Neuroscience\t\tEye tracking\tEarly clinical use of EEG - particularly for diagnosis of epilepsy Event-related potentials due to cognitive processes Functional connectivity of brain networks [assessed in source space] Cross-frequency coupling Brain-computer interface Embodied cognition and emotion [when recorded together with ExG measures] \t\tpoor training of researchers in quality neurophysiological data acquisition and analysis ignorance of pitfalls of analysis of EEG data [by those trained in engineering disciplines] lack of coding skills by those in disciplines such as psychology who plan to do EEG studies\tintegration of EEG, ExG and other data [ANS system measures] in network based analyses of functional connectivity - this may impact assessment of diseases [e.g. for the brain-gut axis and brain-heart axis]\tAI-related signal analysis for BCI applications and the control of remote devices for the handicapped\timplanted electrode arrays targeting motor and sensory cortices for augmenting motor and sensory functions for the wireless control of multiple external devices for the handicapped\tnew MEG technologies such as OPMs will allow better source localization, as well as being relatively portable [this latter aspect will greatly improve in the future]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a continuous activity, even now.\tSome level of checknig will always be needed.\tThis is a best practices issue.\tThat horse bolted from the barn many years ago - the literature is already a mess\t\t\tScalp prep will always be a potential issue.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t I think that a great contribution of the EEG to humanity in the last 100 years is the understanding of epilepsy as a condition originated from electrical brain abnormalities and not as a condition of supernatural origin. 111  \t\tI believe that ignoring the scientific basis of the study may allow indiscriminate use of incorrect or unnecessary treatments.\t\t I think that a very innovative resource would be to carry out recordings with virtual material (electrode or virtual cap, for example).

These interfaces allow individuals to control external devices using their brainwaves, providing hope and improved quality of life for those with severe physical disabilities.\t\t1. Limited Spatial Resolution: EEG provides excellent temporal resolution but relatively poor spatial resolution. It can be challenging to precisely pinpoint the source of neural activity, making it less suitable for tasks requiring fine-grained spatial localization.  2. Signal Artifacts: EEG signals are susceptible to various artifacts, such as muscle activity, eye movements, and external noise. These artifacts can confound data analysis and interpretation, and rigorous preprocessing is required to minimize their impact.  3. Individual Variability: EEG signals vary considerably among individuals due to differences in brain anatomy and electrode placement. This can make it challenging to establish universal norms and diagnostic criteria.\t1. Advanced Signal Processing Techniques: Breakthroughs in signal processing methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are improving the analysis of EEG data. These techniques can enhance the accuracy of brain-computer interfaces, decoding neural activity, and improving the detection of abnormal brain patterns.  2. Multimodal Integration: Combining EEG with other neuroimaging modalities, such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) or TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), allows researchers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of brain function. Integrating EEG with these techniques promises insights into both temporal and spatial aspects of neural activity.  3. Wearable and Portable EEG Devices: The development of compact and portable EEG devices offers the potential for real-time monitoring of brain activity in everyday settings. These devices could revolutionize applications in cognitive enhancement, mental health, and brain-computer interfaces.  4. Closed-Loop Systems: Closed-loop EEG systems, where real-time EEG data informs feedback or interventions, are being explored for applications in neuromodulation, seizure control, and adaptive cognitive training. These systems hold great promise in personalizing treatments and interventions.  5. Cognitive Enhancement and Brain-Computer Interfaces: EEG is integral to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which can assist individuals with disabilities or offer new methods of communication and control. BCIs also hold potential for enhancing human cognition and performance.\tWearable and Non-Invasive EEG Devices: EEG technology will become more accessible through wearable and non-invasive devices that do not require conductive gels or extensive electrode placements. These user-friendly devices will enable individuals to monitor their brain activity in everyday life, offering applications in mental wellness, stress management, and cognitive enhancement.  High-Density EEG Caps: High-density EEG caps with a larger number of electrodes will provide a more detailed view of brain activity. This innovation will improve the spatial resolution of EEG data, making it valuable for precise localization of neural processes and potential clinical applications like epilepsy monitoring.  Dry Electrodes: Advancements in dry electrode technology will eliminate the need for messy gels and extensive preparation. Dry electrodes will make EEG more comfortable and convenient for users and reduce setup time. This innovation will have implications for home-based monitoring and consumer-grade applications.  Closed-Loop Brain-Computer Interfaces: The development of closed-loop BCIs that integrate EEG data with real-time feedback or interventions will revolutionize fields such as neurorehabilitation, neuromodulation, and cognitive enhancement. BCIs will provide adaptive and personalized treatments for individuals with neurological conditions.\tQuantum EEG: In the very long term, advancements in quantum computing may enable the development of quantum EEG systems. These systems could offer unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, allowing researchers to explore the brain&#x27;s quantum properties. This might lead to breakthroughs in understanding consciousness, brain-computer interfaces, and quantum brain dynamics.  Whole-Brain Imaging: EEG technology might evolve to offer whole-brain coverage with the spatial and temporal resolution of current single-electrode EEG. This would provide researchers with the ability to comprehensively study brain function at a fine-grained level. Applications could range from decoding thoughts to early detection of neurological diseases.  Neurological Internet: EEG technology could contribute to the development of a &quot;Neurological Internet&quot; where people could share brain activity data in real-time. This could revolutionize collaborative research, enable unprecedented levels of brain-machine integration, and lead to innovations in education, creativity, and entertainment.  Personalized Brainwave Profiling: EEG technology may provide highly detailed and personalized brainwave profiles for individuals. These profiles could be used to optimize learning, mental health treatment, and cognitive enhancement. Real-time brainwave optimization might be used in education and therapy.  Ethical and Privacy Challenges: As EEG technology becomes more advanced, ethical and privacy concerns will need to be addressed. Access to highly sensitive brain activity data could lead to new ethical dilemmas, and regulations will be crucial to protect individuals&#x27; privacy and autonomy.  Brain-Hardware Interfaces: EEG might be integrated into everyday life through brain-hardware interfaces that facilitate communication, control of devices, and even augmented reality experiences. This integration could enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities and expand human capabilities.  Neuroethics and Policy: Ethical considerations regarding brain data and cognitive freedom will become central to discussions about EEG technology. It will be important to establish global standards and regulations for the responsible use of these technologies, much like we have seen in discussions about AI ethics.  Cognitive Enhancement and Brain Augmentation: With advanced EEG technology, the potential for cognitive enhancement and brain augmentation will be explored more deeply. Techniques for improving memory, cognitive speed, and other mental faculties could be developed, raising questions about equity and fairness.  Real-World Brain Monitoring: Long-term monitoring of brain activity could become a common practice for tracking overall mental health and brain fitness. This might lead to early intervention in neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or other cognitive disorders.  Mind-to-Mind Communication: In the realm of science fiction, but not entirely implausible, advanced EEG technology could enable direct mind-to-mind communication, revolutionizing interpersonal relationships and the way we communicate.\tWearable Neurotechnology: EEG headsets are bulky and require gel application for good contact. Miniaturized, non-invasive, and user-friendly neurosensing devices may become more popular for casual brain monitoring and neurofeedback applications.  Neurochemical Monitoring: Advances in neurochemical sensing could provide complementary information about brain function. For specific applications, such as understanding neurotransmitter dynamics, neurochemical monitoring may surpass the utility of EEG.  Invasive Techniques: For clinical purposes or research on specific neural circuits, invasive methods like intracranial EEG (iEEG) or optogenetics could become more prevalent, offering high-resolution insights into neural processes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEEG has become widely accessible to people across the world and is now a rather low cost option for brain imaging. In the area of epilepsy, EEG has become a key method to characterise seizures and that way contributes importantly to diagnostics.   Sleep research is mainly driven by sleep stage analysis which has advanced not only knowledge on sleep but also allowed to enhance understanding of learning and memory consolidation.   EEG acquisition have been become well standardised and data is comparable across the world. This makes is particularly useful.   Due to its temporal resolution and portability, EEG is the method of choice for real-time assessment of brain response to real-world stimuli. This is why it is an important tool in Brain Computer Interface. \t\tThe main problem is the source localisation and the spatial resolution. The origin of the signal is not clear. \tBrain Computer Interfaces \tI think artificial intelligence will enable more automatised and sophisticated signal processing and the identification of more relevant signatures. This will allow to even better understand cerebral organisation. It will allow to better associate brain to behaviour as well as increase interpretation of brain responses when humans can not express themselves. I also believe that devices will become more easily portable and even more quicker to install. This will enable real-world acquisitions, self-installation, monitoring at home rather than in the hospital.\tWhat a far outreach. Devices will probably get smaller, portable. The information we will be able to derive from the EEG signal will go beyond what we currently imagine. People will do their own EEG at home and transfer the data for research and clinical investgations. \tI assume there will be other biomarkers that could provide redundant information regarding the current brain state and therefore EEG may become less needed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe current knowledge shows little transfer effects or impact on symptoms.\t\t\t\t\t\tI hope never.\t\tFirst, the signature of different pathologic entities has to be identified.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWishful thinking\tWishful thinking\t\t\t\t\t\tI hope\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferentiating seizures from non-seizures.

Also, in sleep studies, nobody sleeps as they would at home because it&#x27;s too uncomfortable.  The biggest barriers in a commercial setting would be lack of convenience, signal quality, and discreteness. Dry electrodes allow for long time monitoring and are comfortable to wear, but the cost is more noisy and way lower spatial resolution signal, limiting the actual application of commercial devices.   \t- Novel electrodes, like hydrogels, that could allow for long term monitoring, are more biocompatible and softer, and match gel quality signal. This would help commercial devices be more comfortable and have more application due to better SNR.  - Using graph neural networks and other advanced machine learning with EEG processing to enable better performance in BCI&#x27;s  - Ear-EEG - the embedding of EEG in audio headphones will normalize EEG signals in the population, like apple watch normalizing other human signals in the population.

Breakthroughs in the use of EEG included ERPs, time-frequency measures, coherence and other cooperativity measures, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and model-dipole and distributed cortical source inverse methods. Ongoing advances include use of EEG to guide brain stimulation, and in brain-computer interfaces. \t\tThe greatest obstacle to progress in use of EEG is the naive mindset that the recorded scalp channel data ARE the true form of the data, and as such are to be interpreted as distinct signals. Too many EEG users and researchers (and clinical neurophysiologists!) still see the data this way.   This situation is akin to a scientific culture in which users of fMRI try to interpret each of the raw radio sensor signals as the only TRUE form of the fMRI data ... analyzing and interpreting it AS IT APPEARS in the separate peri-scalp sensor records.   The myth of EEG as REPRESENTING ONLY the scalp-recorded signals, instead of the summed signals from the wealth of appreciable EEG source processes, retards interest in and therefore progress toward high-resolution 3D EEG source imaging, which IS today feasible.\tAI will increasingly be applied to EEG data, both alone and in concert with MR as well as other synchronously recorded psychophysiological and behavioral measures (ECG, EOG, EMG, eye and body movement, etc.), a framework I have called &#x27;Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (2009). In clinical applications, AI and advanced biophysical imaging methods will be applied to concurrent EEG recording and EM brain stimulation for investigative and therapeutic purposes.\tApplication of AI methods to EEG source imaging and network analysis, including during continuous recordings involving complex stimulation (movies, AR/VR), tasks (navigation, etc.), and interactions (human conversations, team work, etc.). 3D EEG source imaging will become more widely adopted in clinical use, and some home diagnostic and workplace monitoring applications may emerge.\tI foresee the introduction of XHD (extremely high-density) E/M recording - for example, bathing thousands of scalp electrodes in a scalp-worn electrolite &#x27;shampoo&#x27;, with real-time source imaging processed by advanced AI methods delivering accurate assessment of cognition and neuropathology. OPM magnetometry may likewise continue to advance, and have specific applications (in view of its continued higher cost and cumbersome nature relative to EEG alone. XHD MEEG analysis methods will make use of the improved source signal resolution offered by combine MEEG recording. These advances will be made possible by creation of very large archives of well-annotated EEG and MR data, and by ever-advancing progress in computing.\t\t\t\tthey are available now - but are mostly inadequate\t\t\tperhaps for drowsiness detection\thard to say - present state of NF is so primitive\t\twill likely be superseded by invasive measures for this application\t\tI am waiting to find out!\t\thard to guess\tI write in ~20 yrs - but has THAT much progress been made in the last 20 years?\t\t\t\t\tThey are now (joke).\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunlikly\t\thard to say ...\t\tI once suggested this to E.

In the use of neuro-feedback allowing medical use (help for TDAH notably) and a better understanding of the plasticity and control of our cognitive process. \t\tI don&#x27;t see any risk  in the use of EEG.\tI think of four major improvement that will change the future of EEG: - Reduction of the cost - Increase of the portability - Increase of the SNR with mathematics and machine learning - Discovery that will come through connectivity  The reduction of the cost of the EEG system lead to an increae of its use, and increase the probability of making discovery and overcome the challenge when using it.   The increase of portability will allow the use of the EEG in more context, paradigm more ecological and patient that could use it more.  The increase of the SNR with our understanding of the EEG signal and our manipulation through mathematics and machine learning will help getting a better a signal and be closer to &#x27;the truth&#x27; which will definitely change our perception of many previous finding.  I think in relation with the previous one, the development of connectivity analysis is one of the most important breakthroughs that has started. We don&#x27;t know yet how much it will impact our understanding of the brain mechanisms but it look like a very promising approach.\tMore standard tools to extract and clean the data of the EEG. Tools that are consensual, for the moment a lot of pipeline are made, but there is a lot of disagreement, I think principally because we need to have a better understanding of what happen with processing of the data. I think that machine learning in addition to the more collaborative/interdisciplinary way of doing science now will lead to more consensual and efficient tools.\tTo have EEG that could be more comfortable (no gel, water) and easier to wear, not directly plug to a box, also with the capacity to detect the signal in a very efficient way.  This will lead to an increase of the use of this device in everyday life to track our cognition and interact better with our fatigue, stress, emotion and attention. It will lead to a better understanding of the cognitive science, with more ecological design that allow people to use the eeg in many context, such as going to work with it for instance. \tI don&#x27;t think. For me it is the more promising techinque with the FNIRS, but that are not redudant as measuring different phsyiological mechanisms. I sometimes see some redundancy with the MEG but I think that the EEG is more promising as MEG is not suitable in any environment like EEG due to it&#x27;s sensitivity to magnetism.  \t\tI don&#x27;t have enough information for this one\t\t\tI don&#x27;t have enough information for this one\t\t\t\t\t\tI don&#x27;t have enough information for this one\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately, I don&#x27;t think that we will have a universal guideline on that\t\t\t\tI think that lie is a social concept but it&#x27;s not different from the truth anatomically\t\t\t\tI think that automatic processing already outpeform human in the sense that it remove subjectivity. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEntropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity\tMEG\tThe biggest breakthrough application, in my view, is the combined use of EEG with TMS to infer consciousness based on EEG complexity, i.e., the perturbational complexity index (Casali et al. 2013). \t\t1) Difficulty of source localization, the inverse problem; 2) Difficulty of cleaning artifacts from data\treal-time data cleaning (e.g., something along the lines of artifact subspace reduction)\tIn the near-term, I think EEG entropy/complexity will be often used for detecting covert consciousness (i.e., cognitive-motor dissociation) \tLong-term applications would be innovations in intracranial EEG (e.g., along the lines of what Neuralink aims to do), but this might be considered ECoG rather than EEG.

Unfortunately, research in these areas is inconsistent, likely due to considerable variability across individuals even within diagnoses that makes practical applications (for example moving from an EEG established biomarker to a treatment or treatment response prediction) very difficult. Similarly, advances in the application of EEG with regards to cognition have been interesting and have advanced our understanding of how the brain works, but these advances have been of limited practical application thus far.  In contrast, the use of EEG to diagnose epilepsy has become the gold standard. EEG can also be used to predict the depth of anaesthetic response, both with profound clinical application. Brain computer interface methods have not yet reached their potential, but are rapidly developing, and the scope for assisting people with disabilities is considerable.   The breakthroughs that have enabled these practical applications have been cumulative, and many of these breakthroughs are now 50+ years old. Firstly, digitization of the EEG signal was a critical breakthrough, enabling the applications I mentioned above. Secondly, the removal of confounding artifacts has developed considerably to the point where the influence of these artifacts is likely to be minimal. Third, transformations enabling the computation of relevant metrics have advanced considerably, for example oscillatory power computations (with the recent and very important addition of the removal of non-oscillatory 1/f activity). Event-related potential analyses have enabled us to detect consistent phasic responses to stimuli, enabling vastly improved understanding of how the brain undertakes cognition. And measures of connectivity between different electrodes / brain regions have improved to the point they&#x27;re likely to no longer be severely impacted by confounds.   More recent advances have included source separation methods to allow researchers to focus on activity produced by specific brain regions, or activity related to specific events (for example with generalised eigenvector decompositions). Experimental design advances have allowed hyperscanning methods to examine connectivity of brain activity between different people. And intermodulation techniques which present two different oscillatory signals - one fast frequency that recruits lower order visual processing and one slower frequency that recruits higher order semantic processing (for example faces that appear intermittently from the lower order patterns) - followed by examination of the enhancements of interactions between these two frequencies in the brain - have provided evidence in support of the predictive coding account of consciousness. Finally, machine learning techniques are just beginning to provide considerable scope in decoding the relationship between multivariate brain activity patterns and perception / cognition, as well as the potential for diagnosis / prediction of treatment response.\t\tThe massive number of EEG recording, pre-processing, and analysis parameters, as well as the huge number of potential datapoints (with EEG recorded from &amp;gt;60 electrodes across long durations of recordings) provides massive researcher degrees of freedom, and associated high likelihood of false positives and non-replicable research.   Similarly, the complexity of EEG data analysis means that it&#x27;s entirely possible that significant and meaningful effects are missed. By way of example, we recently published work using a highly comparative analysis approach that mindfulness meditation was associated with increased stationarity of the EEG signal, but not with differences in measures of frequency power or signal complexity / entropy. Prior to our work, measures of stationarity have never been examined in mindfulness meditation, and have been barely examined in neuroscience. In contrast, many hypothesis driven studies examining a single metric have examined frequency power and complexity / entropy measures.\tMachine learning techniques offer considerable scope for diagnosis, treatment prediction, and decoding brain activity.  Massive and openly available data sets have the potential to establish biomarkers through massively increased statistical power.   Advanced intermodulation techniques have the potential to test theories of how the brain produces consciousness, and the deep explanations for brain function.  Brain computer interfaces have the potential to drastically increase human function.\tLarge open access datasets with the potential for application of new techniques to extract considerable advances in our understanding of brain activity.  Machine learning and source separation techniques that enable drastically improved understanding of brain function and vastly improved diagnostic potential.\tVery conjecture, but: the combination of fNIRS and EEG to enable simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution, along with advanced computation techniques to enable direct and immediate understanding of brain function on an individual level.

Incorrect statistics results, incorrect signal processing, and incorrect machine learning use.  \tWell, I am not an expert of LLM, I will not be able to comment on EEG with respect to LLM.

However, it is obvious that with advent of other technologies, the EEG will definitely emerge and will have bright future in practice other than clinics and hospitals. \tThis does not make sense. EEG means the way brain voltage potentials are captured. Now, how much the technologies are changed, our brain will be still generating electrical signals, and the capturing of those electrical signals will give you EEG signals.  So from the question, if you are trying to say that there will be an alternative way of capturing brain electrical signals because of advances, that will be still called EEG.

EEG allowed to objectively demonstrate the positive and negative effects of the environmental factors and pharmacological agents, supported development of early screening approaches that could provide information before the behavioral symptoms become apparatent.\t\tThe biggest challenge is the high variability in the hardware, software, recording and analysis procedures that interfere with the ability to develop universal normative values needed to conclusively interpret research cortical EEG data at the level of single subject (the subcortical ABRs made good progress in that direction; epilepsy diagnosis based on the presence of distinct EEG features is an exception). The extreme flexibility in the acquisition and analysis approaches make EEG a flexible tool, facilitating research in many clinical populations, but at the same time, this flexibility also diminishes the strength of the interpretation and limits EEG applications as treatment outcomes or biomarkers (i.e., beyond epilepsy, etc.).\tAutomated validated data cleaning and processing pipelines, modern analyses (including those supported by machine learning/AI techniques) that move beyond the individual peaks and frequency bands to use the complex information from high-density montages and multiple paradigms to extract novel EEG-based indices of brain activity (entropy, etc.).\tFully wireless systems with dry electrodes that can be applied quickly, even by an untrained subject (or with minimal guidance from a researcher) and provide high-quality data at low cost - this would allow to broaden the reach of EEG studies to more remote areas and/or low-incidence clinical conditions, improving access to research for these populations and yielding more representative data.

Such engineering development have accompanied by computational and mathematical development such as analysis methods such as machine learning including noise reduction methods enabled application of brain computer interface in real life scenario. \t\tAs for research, it&#x27;s spatial resolution has fundamental limit compared to MEGs/ fMRI. For clinical application, the most advanced EEG knowledge in research has not well shared with local medical doctors and engineers yet, requiring education for clinicians to get the most of scientific discoveries. Lastly for commercial EEGs, cheap and wearable devices have been proposed on the market but their data quality and the lack of number of electrodes significantly lower the quality and decodability of EEGs, so the balance between precision as in research and usability in daily life as in commercial settings is a key. \tThe social implementation of brain-computer interface in daily life and its combination with IoT informatics would unveil thousands of real-world neuroscience discoveries that in laboratory research could not have reveal. \tDaily life monitoring of EEGs would lead to validation of existing EEG markers in literature in laboratory settings, and advancement of wearability and BCI would bring a \u201cuse case scenario\u201d of utilizing EEGs in daily life.

Quantification and evaluation of the neural abilities (brain capital) would be somewhat considered as an ethical issue as privacy acts, that said, informatic security will be cared after for EEGs.\tIn a controlled environment, decoding of neural activities from contactless technologies may be practically used in the future, for clinical diagnosis wearable MEGs may overtake EEGs. \tCombined with adaptive robotics, an automated EEG device that fits to all will be invented. 25 years\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the early years, the impacts of EEG on our understanding of clinical conditions, such as epilepsy, coma, etc., were truly outstanding. More recently, major breakthroughs in analysis methods, including better source localization, time-frequency, functional connectivity (PLV), network properties, etc., have had tremendous impact on the range of hypotheses that can be tested with EEG. This has resulted in an explosion in the use of EEG for fundamental cognitive neuroscience reasearch.\t\tThere is a major trade off between quality of data (signal to noise, spatial sampling density, etc) and impediments such as time required for set up, portability of data collection apparatus, fragility of electrodes and wires, etc.\tAnalysis methods are continuing to develop rapidly, including machine learning approaches. Machine learning could identify spatiotemporal features in EEG data that have not yet been considered and that could lead to breakthroughs in either clinical or basic science research.\tFaster analysis enabling real-time quantification of a variety of specific EEG signals, is likely to soon lead to better brain-computer interfaces for applications including prosthetics and other performance aids, and for biofeedback to assist with pain treatment, mental health, etc.\tCheaper, more portable and easier to use devices could lead to many commercial applications for entertainment, household tasks, etc\tAdvances in MEG may lead to less use of EEG for research and clinical applications, just as fMRI replaced O15 PET.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly neonatal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI hope not!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis will change every few years as technology advances \t\tOnly for clinical applications.

Event-Related Potentials (ERPs, 1950s): The discovery of event-related potentials allowed researchers to study the brain&#x27;s response to specific stimuli or events. This breakthrough has been fundamental in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, providing insights into perception, attention, and memory.  Brain-Computer Interfaces and real-time neurofeedback: EEG was instrumental in the development of BCIs, which enable individuals to control computers and devices directly with their thoughts. Using real-time neurofeedback Individuals can learn to self-regulate their brain activity for therapeutic purposes.  Wearable EEG Devices (Recent): Miniaturized and consumer-friendly EEG devices have been entering the market, enabling continuous monitoring and real-world applications. \t\t- Low signal to noise ratio,  - Low spatial resolution,  - Long set up time requiring applying gel (the dry electrodes are uncomfortable to use and have lower signal to noise ratio) - Lack of big datasets with big sample sizes and multiple sessions \t- Recent new designs of commercially off-the-shelf EEG headsets that are less expensive, easier set up, more comfortable to wear - Open Science for sharing data and EEG analysis pipeline -Use of EEG in BCI for non-invasive neuo-rehabilitation (e.g. for stroke) - EEG-based neuro\t- Improved wearable consumer-grade EEG devices with soft non-gel electrodes, printable electrodes etc. - Neurofeedback and Brain Training as commercially available tools  - Closed-loop Brain-computer Interface commonly used for neurorehabilitation in clinics - EEG combined with TES for Closed loop non-invasive brain stimulation  - Personalised treatment (EEG data can guide personalised treatments for conditions like epilepsy, depression, and ADHD, helping to predict the treatment outcomes and interven earlier)  \tProlonged Monitoring and Early Detection: Long-term EEG monitoring could aid in the early detection of neurological conditions, allowing for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.  Ethics, Privacy, and Regulations: As EEG technology advances, robust ethical, privacy, and regulatory frameworks will be needed to address issues related to data security, consent, and the responsible use of neurotechnologies.  Neurosecurity: The long-term implications of EEG technology include the need for secure brain data storage and protection against unauthorized access, potentially giving rise to an entirely new field of neurosecurity.  - As technology evolves, there may be synergistic relationships between EEG and other neuroimaging methods, leading to complementary rather than competitive roles in neuroscience and clinical practice.\tDirect Neural Interfaces: Emerging technologies like optogenetics and neural dust allow for more direct access to brain activity. These techniques can provide specific information about neural circuits and individual neurons, which may outperform EEG in understanding brain function at a finer scale. Miniaturized brain-machine interfaces, such as neural dust or brainwave-reading wearables, may offer more user-friendly and practical solutions for applications like brain-computer communication, gaming, and augmented reality. \t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot sure about it\tPerhaps due to ethical issues\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe importance of locating the epileptogenic zone, as the objective of epielpsy surgery, as well as being a tool to make accurate diagnoses and provide timely treatments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh temporal resolution method, cheap compared with other neuroscience methods (eg fmri) and easy to acquire.

Most notably I&#x27;d say sleep issues/monitoring, epilepsy, and forms of altered cognition (like anesthesia, among others). I think, as AI and machine learning expands further and integrates with the field, we will also see an increased ability for cheaper headsets to impart more knowledge about the above in addition to &quot;daily cognition&quot;, and with the right knowledge and management, this can even be a process which bolsters the consumer EEG market, which is currently a mixed bag of high-quality ideas and consumerism driven hogwash. \t\tIn a research and clinical capacity, the biggest issue I consistently see is cost. High-quality EEG set-ups are pricey and often to the exclusion of most moderately funded labs. There are cheaper options, but the lapse in signal quality can be staggering and often the results can not compare to more expensive headsets. However, with the availability of these cheaper headsets, and the lack of qualified EEG scientists outside academia, many groups are doing research, neuromarketing, exploration, etc. and gathering EEG data that is not usable or even qualified as &quot;brain-sourced data&quot;. However, with more knowledge of marketing taglines than EEG measurement principles, they often think they&#x27;re getting good data and then present that data due to the cheaper software&#x27;s program doing quick FFT and presenting brainwave data no matter the underlying signal quality.  Personally, I have worked heavily in the field of states of consciousness, meditation, and mental health. In this field I have been a contract neuroscientist for many years, helping private groups and companies through neuroscientific measurement and analysis. There&#x27;s been a few cheap headsets that have become popular in this space that are churning out false information at an alarming rate. In one particular case I worked with a company charmed by the Muse headset. They had all this data they had pulled out to make a lot of wild claims about their meditations. When I got the raw data and did proper analysis on it, I found the results to not share even one similarity with the conclusions that had been come to through usage of the device.  There is a way to get useful data from the Muse when you understand how the device really works and can pull the raw data straight out, but I only have met one other person who can do this in my career. I&#x27;m sure plenty of scientists have work arounds for the Muse and other consumer headsets, but those of us who can are not prominent in the field enough to correct this trend of false EEG data and methods leveraged for consumerism driven gains and conclusions.  On that same not, albeit a much smaller issue in the grand scheme of neuroscience, is the increase in neuroscience &quot;hokum&quot; and pseudoscience. I notice an increasing amount of pseudoscientists, authors, marketers, etc., (like Joe Dispenza-like figures, NeoRhythm and entrainment devices, and so on.) using EEG as a way to charm consumers into buying into claims and belief systems. While I&#x27;ve historically tracked this issue to be prevalent at least within the last half a century, I think it is increasing as these technologies make more headlines. I often work at the intersection of science and society, between academia and lay people. I think the relationship people have with science in our modern world is important, as trust is vital in science&#x27;s process of informing and improving mental and physical health. Unfortunately, many people don&#x27;t trust science in 2023. I&#x27;ve already run into several instances where followers of pseudo-neuroscience clash heavily with scientists, stifling projects, progress, and slowly eroding trust in scientists as folks in the private and public consumer sector prefer marketing bullet points to legitimate conclusions.\tAs much as portable, cheap headsets have caused issues in science, as I mentioned above, I really do think there is a generation of these cheaper headsets coming that are vastly improved. I&#x27;d be looking at future versions of headset like Neurosity&#x27;s Crown with eagerness. If the cost comes down and real EEG data can be gathered through these portable, cheaper headsets, it&#x27;ll open the doors to many labs being able to gather data on a myriad of conditions, no longer bound by budgets and having to physically be in the lab.\tHigh-quality, portable, AI/machine learning driven headsets that open up the research field to experiments which could not be conducted previously.\tBCI-based wearables like glasses, headphones, hats, etc. that integrate neuroscientific data in continuously measured data streams geared for wellness and mood management. Also, BCI-based treatments for sensory issues and artificial limb movement.\tWhile many folks want the &quot;think of my lights to turn on, and they do&quot;, style BCI, I think voice recognition makes this redundant. Voice will always be quicker, easier, more reliable, and not requiring of electrode placements.

There has been a great deal of progress in this area, but frequencies &amp;gt;15 Hz are not really possible in my experience. Getting your hair messed up is a real impediment to getting EEG recordings from as many people as possible.  2) The development of *accurate* source localization. This has not been achieved yet, even with MRI co-registration, dense electrode arrays, MEG, and the development of various localization methods. We still need to be able to measure the conductivity of intracranial tissues in order for accurate source localization to become a regularly-used tool.  3) Understanding how exactly neural activity propagates to scalp sensors/electrodes. There has been very little research done on this. We need to have simultaneous laminar CSD and scalp electrode recordings. Then we might be able to start interpreting EEG/MEG phenomena in terms of actual circuit activity.\tDry electrode systems are getting better and better. Hopefully soon we&#x27;ll be able to get clean recordings across the frequency spectrum.  I&#x27;m not aware of what initiatives might be underway to improve source localization and to get simultaneous recordings of interlaminar and scalp electrode data. Maybe there are through the US BRAIN initiative.\t\tWe&#x27;ll be using some method (maybe not in existence yet) to non-invasively record precisely localized neural activity throughout the brain.\tNot in the foreseeable future.

This laid the foundation for understanding brain activity as well as sleep physiology. What comes next is the Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which are brain responses to specific stimuli or events. This has been instrumental in cognitive neuroscience and studying cognitive processes.\tNeurofeedback and Brain Training\tEEG has relatively low spatial resolution compared to other neuroimaging techniques like fMRI. It can provide information about brain activity but lacks the ability to pinpoint the exact location of neural activity. Also, EEG signals can be affected by various sources of noise, such as electrical interference, head and body movements, and artifacts from the environment. This makes it challenging to obtain clean and reliable data.\tEEG has been integral in the development of brain-computer interfaces, enabling individuals to control external devices using their brain signals. \tit is possible we can reveal the essence of sleep. Also, wearable EEG devices are expected to become more accessible and user-friendly. These lightweight, comfortable, and portable devices can facilitate research in naturalistic settings and may have applications in monitoring brain health, stress, and mental well-being in real-world contexts.\tBe able to read people&#x27;s minds via real-time EEG data.\tFuture innovations in sensing technologies, like quantum sensors, may offer novel ways to study brain activity with higher precision and sensitivity than conventional EEG.\tCombining EEG with other neuroimaging modalities like fMRI, MEG, or near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can provide a more comprehensive view of brain function. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tskilled EEG Technicians are getting scarcer\tICU applications\tbrain computer interfaces\tas above\tlesional localisation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tClinical Psychology\t\tHRV\tThis question is strange. \t\tNot relevant\tNot relevant\t-\t-\tNo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEG\tEEG rythmes \t\tEEG use without sufficient knowledge and data processing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFFR\t\t\tCosts and inconvenience of testing - I mean it is overall much cheaper and more convenient than fMRI for example, but still, you need specialist equipment and conditions and a fair amount of training to be able to use it properly\tResearch into mobile EEG (and other imaging techniques); I&#x27;m still a bit sceptical about the equipment (about to test MUSE band) but with the technology development, we should be able to get better signal with less cumbersome testing conditions and that would open some opportunities for research in places that was not possible before\tSmaller more portable electrodes and battery systems, stronger amplifiers, better algorithms and tech for keeping good SNR\tBrain measurements integrated into daily devices (e.g., headphones, hats, glasses)\t\t\tThis is possible but not sure as to resolution/fidelity of these data (not familiar with clinical applications as much)\tThis is available to some degree but with big &quot;but&quot; about the quality of collected data, to be &quot;widely &quot; available they need to be shown reliable, helpful and be much much cheaper\t\t\t\tI don&#x27;t believe this can happen any time soon - you can&#x27;t get the visit at the GP or a therapist, yet alone get access to wearable tech\t\tHopefully!\tTechnology yes, much sooner, but access is not going to happen any time soon\tI don&#x27;t know much about prenatal and neonatal imaging so can&#x27;t comment at all\tNow\tAgain, cost as a big barrier.

I think this has been at the level of the cortex, as I believe EEG cannot tap into subcortical regions, or at least not with high precision.   An important application of EEG is in developmental neuropsychology, allowing researchers a non-invasive way to study the brains of children.   Another is in cognitive neuroscience, allowing us to understand brain activity following the presentation of visual or auditory stimuli.  Reading the areas below, I think I also recall reading work on how it can advance our understanding of brain waves during sleep. \t\tThe lack of precision of where the brain activity is coming from. (I have research interests in subcortical areas and the connections between subcortical and cortical regions, and I believe EEG is limited in its ability to study subcortical regions).\tFactors that influence (promote or interfere with) child cognitive function.\tI don&#x27;t know, but it would be fantastic if it could be used to study subcortical brain activity, and the covariance between subcortical and cortical. Though Im not sure how it might add to what we can do with MRI, it could perhaps help corroborate findings, and potentially be used as a tool for people who cannot do MRIs (e.g metal in body; claustrophobic; obese; motor disorders, etc), or in populations that might be more hesitant to do MRIs (e.g., infants; as a parent I would be more comfortable doing a study where I can hold my child with EEG recordings than placing them in an MRI alone).\tNo idea. If anything, I wonder if it may get phased out by advanced in other technologies (such as PET, MRI). However the non-invasiveness and ease of use, coupled with less expense (I believe) may make it more likely to continue living on.\tIn populations where other modalities can be used, such as healthy people, who can perhaps provide more in depth information from PET and MRIs.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontributing to cognitive neuroscience\t\tGeneral tendency by scientists to over-interpret their own work&#x27;s significance.

Changing the culture such that postdocs also try only to do beautiful work and preparing them for the unfortunate but inevitable consequence that they will not be able to get an academic career on the back of it. Tackling the community to try to avoid a focus on getting a &quot;major breakthrough&quot;.

Lack of communication -- substantive and engaging between clinical providers and the medical / neuroscience side of the house.\tI am aware of no current developments or efforts that could lead to [bolded] major developments.  The EEG captures the complexity of neural systems, a domain where non-linear dynamics and quantum mechanics are relevant due to their focus on unpredictable systems. In non-linear dynamics, unpredictability stems from how minor variations in starting conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. In quantum mechanics, unpredictability results from inherent uncertainties, such as the indeterminacy of a particle&#x27;s position and momentum. Both fields utilize sophisticated mathematical models for description and prediction: quantum mechanics employs wave functions and matrix mechanics, while non-linear dynamics uses iterative equations and concepts like strange attractors. A vital aspect of both fields is their investigation of complex phenomena emerging from the interactions of simpler elements. In neuroscience, for example, the intricate behavior of the brain arises from the interactions of neurons, observable through spiking neurons that contribute to local field potentials at various spatial and temporal scales. These interactions, governed by principles of non-linear dynamics, contribute to the EEG signals that we observe at a macroscopic level. Yet, these signals originate from micro-level activities of spiking neurons. So, until we bridge non-linear dynamics with quantum mechanics into a unified EEG theoretical framework, there will be no genuine &quot;major breakthroughs.&quot;  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot in hhow EEG is currently analyzed\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot in hhow EEG is currently analyzed\tNot in hhow EEG is currently analyzed\t\t\tNot in hhow EEG is currently analyzed\tNot in hhow EEG is currently analyzed\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCross-frequency coupling analysis\tEye tracking\tAs a direct measure of brain activity, EEG can address fundamental questions about how the human brain implements specific behaviors under investigation, and how the human brain works broadly. EEG thus allows us to go beyond establishing a brain correlate and toward establishing novel mechanistic explanations of the brain basis of behavior. This is the primary goal of cognitive neuroscience, and a prerequisite of effective clinical and translational neuroscience. EEG is a fundamental basic and translational neuroscience tool, and it is both safe and inexpensive. Major breakthroughs: neural oscillations develop (e.g., alpha oscillations speed up during childhood and reach adult-like ~10 Hz levels in early adolescence), sleep-related memory deficits in aging are related to mismatched slow wave-spindle coupling, working memory is supported by frontal-posterior interactions at multiple frequencies, and basic signatures of brain function such as the novelty response are diminished in patients with frontal lobe damage.\t\tThe biggest risks of using EEG in any setting is misunderstanding of how the technology works, what the electrical signals it measures signify, and how to perform rigorous analyses on the electrical signals.\tPromising current developments include EEG-guided neurostimulation and the use of EEG in longitudinal designs.\tI expect improve source localization algorithms, understanding that the inverse problem has no solution. Moreover, I expect the field of neurostimulation, especially tES, to adopt EEG-guided approaches. EEG-guided tES would achieve the goal of individually tailoring stimulation to achieve maximal efficacy on the group level, which is critical to basic and translational applications of tES.\tTo my knowledge, the technology itself has not changed much in the last 100 years, but the analytic tools (e.g., sophisticated signal processing techniques and inferential statistics) and applications have.

Many early discoveries continue to have implications today in important areas such as clinical diagnosis and BCI. I predict that the societal impact of using EEG to measure cognitive states will grow as EEG technology becomes increasingly consumerized.\t\tMost EEG technology is designed to work well for people with smooth or straight hair. People with coarse or curly hair are often excluded from participating in research, reducing sample diversity. People with coarse or curly hair may also be at a disadvantage when receiving a clinical diagnosis that relies on EEG.\tReal-world neuroscience can be difficult due to the cumbersome nature of the equipment. Portable technology often represents a compromise (e.g., far fewer sensors compared to a laboratory system). However, improvements in portable EEG that offer discrete and numerous sensors could lead to a boom in ecologically valid neuroscience research.\tThere are several consumer-level EEG devices on the market currently. I expect this number will increase by an order of magnitude over the next 10 years. I believe we will see some interesting and unexpected applications once this technology becomes more integrated with existing wearables. As research on biomarkers continues to grow, one potential implication I can see is a greater need to consider privacy related to EEG data.\tI expect that the sensors will shrink in size and increase in number, perhaps becoming integrated with fabric and essentially invisible. If the technology becomes as ubiquitous as smartphones, we may see an explosion of applications ranging from mundane (an EEG &quot;fingerprint&quot; to unlock your device) to more exciting advances in BCI.\tTo the extent that EEG and MEG are measuring similar processes, EEG may become somewhat redundant as MEG technology continues to miniaturize and come down in cost.\tI predict that within 20 years insurance companies will begin to inquire about whether potential clients are recording their EEG, with the goal of eventually checking for biomarkers of neurological disorders.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- clinical: applications in epilepsy, sleep  -research: information processing with EEG/ERP, e.g. early vs late sensory processing, semantic processing of non-consciously perceived events, processing of errors/performance monitoring,\t\tignorance of the inverse problem\tminiaturization of EEG hardware and the development of non-invasive, chronic EEG assessment in daily life, including the development of better electrodes (based on flex-printed technology)\tEEG acquisition included in consumer electronics, such as earpods, for collecting health-related information.  in combination with other sensors (in particular IMUs) activity recognition will be possible and EEG will be instrumental in detecting motivation/alertness/attention/performance of humans in various complex scenarios\tvision outlined above might take more than 10 years...\tno, EEG will surpass other brian monitoring technnologies, because it is rich in content and truly mobile.

From the applicability standpoint, there&#x27;s just too much to list. Some examples might include the discovery of event related potentials/responses (including event related synchronization/desynchronization), detection of epileptic activity or characterization of various sleep stages.\t\tBiggest barriers are uncertainty of data origin, lack of anatomical precision especially on the level of the individual, low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationarities in data between recording sessions/individuals (different electrode placements, different anatomy, etc.). These factors limit the applicability of EEG in both research, clinical and especially commercial settings (poor generalization of applications).\tTwo areas might experience breakthrough shortly: i) developing EEG recording techniques that would allow for stable outside-of-the-lab recordings on the long term (i.e., EEG wearables), and ii) developing data analysis techniques that would be able to ameliorate data non-stationarity, leading to more stable performance on the individual level.\tEEG wearables - once a successful product is introduced, the amount of available EEG data would grow exponentially, further helping the development/refinement of new methods.\tAccessible and well-performing neuromonitoring (including BCI) technology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think that the Libet-Experiment was a major breakthrough. \t\tI think the biggest issue in EEG research are researchers&#x27; degrees of freedom during analysis. It is well known that degrees of freedom during analysis create the opportunity of p-hacking. In combination with small sample sizes, I am afraid I think a large part of the current research literature is not reliable.   I think the greatest challenges to clinical and commercial settings is to find EEG markers that allow to identify things of interest reliably on the level of single subjects, not only on the group level. \tFor research: Preregistration of analysis pipelines.  Machine learning techniques \tno idea\tno idea\tSInce most technologies become redundant with time, it is to be expected that we will develop methods that are going to replace EEG eventually.

Lower cost comsumer technology will increase the adoption of EEG technology for real-world applications, coupled with scientific improvements of dealing with artifact sources in such applications.   \tEEG technology will become one of a set of various indicators for an automated inference system, that also includes active control either via direct neuromodulation, or external (e.g., audiovisual stimulation). Electrical brain recordings will become a population-wide screening tool for clinical purposes after it has been more widely distributed within enthusiast consumer applications. Initial applications will underwhelm consumers, but over multiple development cycles, increasingly exciting applications will emerge. Unobtrusive wearable EEG sensors will aid accessibility, and population-wide recordings will jump-start also academic research into quickly improving EEG inference (similar to how the availability of vast training data aided the translation of machine learning technologies into innovative applications.\t- Lab research may decrease due to the public proliferation of EEG - clinical use will shift and become more automated, it may be that lower-cost biological or behavioral markers will be used clinically - advances in other human brain imaging technologies will reduce the independent and predominany use of EEG on research\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt will not be the primary tool, but maybe provide additional signs, and it&#x27;s low cost may lead to it becoming the primary tool at lower precision in lower income regions\t\tAlso MEG etc.\t\t\tIf so only as a supplementary marker\t\t\tProliferation of consumer grade technology will enable at least some limited applications that may become more precise over time\t\tThey are already\tThey already exist, but their wide spread will still take some time\tThey will allow control of EEG-inspired UIs\tInitially as an enthusiast feature, they may never become the sole standard, much like 2AFC today\t\t\t\t\tOther techniques will prove more successful at this\tIf so, only in combination with othe rmethodologies\t\t\tThe consensus will be something adaptive, not one size fits all\t\tPeople will move away from the resting state paradigm\tTo neural processes maybe, with some stochastic link to cognition\tNo, but EEG will become one type of sensor among a more diverse array \tDriven by consumer applications, a limited sensor setup will become sufficiently affordable\tAt least for simple markers like alpha and related applications\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a researcher within sleep, I would say the discovery of different sleep stages.  Also my impression as a cognitive neuroscientist is that EEG to a large degree laid the foundations for understanding brain dynamics, eg variation in states, the distinct marker of error processing and so on.\t\tNot very familiar, but lack of possibility for mobile recording? Using it in a naturalistic setting?\t\t\t\tNo\tAs someone outside the field, it was very interesting to learn about all these potential options. Some of them, related to personal use and AI I think are quite ghastly. I say this as someone who is getting more and more interested in embodied cognition and affective neuroscience. I think both the brain itself, the nervous system at large and personal identity / disease states are way too complex that EEG alone can be used for personalised treatment and &quot;unlocking someone&#x27;s full potential&quot;. It would probably be easier to just talk to the person regarding that :) And, the ethics surrounding this must be considered. Also, although I see possibilities for using eeg-mobile interface as promising for collecting clinical data, I don&#x27;t think it is a good idea that continuous brain monitoring becomes commercially available. We are already too much consumed with activity bands and sleep apps. People should rather be taught the importance of being in the present and understanding their own states rather than having their cell phones tell them. I also believe that consciousness and mental states are much more complex than people in the AI community appear to think. Machines are not human.\t\t\tI hope never \t\tI hope this will only be available for clinical use if it ever happens \t\tNeed signal from basal ganglia / not just cortical surface?\t\t\t\tWhy isn&#x27;t this already being done!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo important \tThis must be done before any of the above (AI.

This breakthrough allowed scientists to record electrical activity in the brain, marking the beginning of the era of brainwave research. It laid the foundation for the study of brain disorders and cognitive functions. Then, in the 1930s, researchers identified different types of brainwaves, including alpha and beta waves. This discovery led to the understanding that different brainwave patterns are associated with various states of consciousness, such as relaxation (alpha) and alertness (beta). Event-related potentials (ERPs), which are specific patterns of EEG activity in response to sensory, cognitive, or motor events have been instrumental in cognitive neuroscience, allowing researchers to investigate the timing and processing of cognitive functions. Also, EEG became an invaluable tool in diagnosing and understanding epilepsy. The distinctive spike-and-wave patterns seen in epileptic patients&#x27; EEG recordings helped in the diagnosis and treatment of this neurological disorder. One thing that is really exciting for me is the Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). EEG technology played a pivotal role in the development of BCIs, allowing individuals to control external devices using their brain signals. This innovation has had a profound impact on people with severe disabilities, enabling them to communicate and interact with the world. Integrating EEG to fMRI allowed researchers to simultaneously capture information about brain structure and function. This integration improved our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and brain regions, leading to advancements in cognitive neuroscience and clinical applications. Advances in EEG hardware and signal processing have enabled real-time monitoring of brain activity outside of the lab. This has applications in gaming, market research, and the development of brain-controlled consumer devices. And maybe the most interesting is the AI and Machine Learning in EEG Analysis. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in EEG analysis has allowed for more accurate and efficient data interpretation. This has implications for diagnosing neurological disorders and understanding complex brain processes. EEG-based BCIs continue to advance, offering new hope for individuals with locked-in syndrome or severe paralysis. These interfaces are evolving rapidly, raising ethical and privacy concerns as well as exciting possibilities for human-computer interaction. Overall, the major breakthroughs in EEG technology over the last century have transformed our understanding of the brain, its functions, and its disorders. They have also opened up new avenues for clinical applications, neurorehabilitation, and human-computer interaction, contributing to the betterment of society while raising important ethical and societal questions about the potential uses and misuse of this technology.\tLanguage\tThe use of EEG in research, clinical, and commercial settings is accompanied by several challenges and risks. These include the complexity of interpreting EEG data, susceptibility to signal noise, limited spatial resolution, ethical concerns regarding data privacy and misuse, the choice between invasive and non-invasive techniques, issues of reliability and reproducibility, potential for commercial hype, regulatory and certification challenges, data security concerns, evolving neuroethical questions, and barriers related to cost and accessibility. Addressing these issues is essential to harness the full potential of EEG technology while ensuring its responsible and effective utilization in various fields.\tAmong the most promising current developments in EEG technology, several hold the potential for major breakthroughs in its use and utility. Firstly, the integration of advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques is revolutionizing EEG data analysis. These approaches can uncover intricate patterns and correlations in brainwave data, leading to more precise diagnoses and a deeper understanding of brain function. Secondly, the adoption of high-density EEG systems with an increased number of electrodes promises to significantly enhance spatial resolution, enabling researchers to pinpoint the source of neural activity with unprecedented precision. Thirdly, the growing field of neuroethics and policy research is laying the groundwork for responsible and ethical EEG use, addressing concerns related to data privacy, informed consent, and equitable access. Collectively, these developments are poised to usher in a new era of EEG applications, expanding its impact across neuroscience, clinical practice, and societal domains, much like the transformative influence of AI models in the field of language processing.\tIn the near future, EEG technology is likely to witness several groundbreaking innovations. One promising avenue is the development of even more portable and wearable EEG devices with improved signal quality, which could enable continuous, real-time monitoring of brain activity in everyday life. This innovation has profound implications for research, as it would allow researchers to study brain dynamics in naturalistic settings, advancing our understanding of cognition, emotion, and neurological disorders. Additionally, the integration of EEG with other neuroimaging modalities, such as fNIRS and functional ultrasound, may provide a more comprehensive view of brain function. Moreover, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning will likely lead to more automated and accurate EEG data analysis, potentially streamlining diagnostics and personalized treatments in clinical applications. As EEG becomes more accessible and sophisticated, it holds the promise of revolutionizing neurorehabilitation, cognitive enhancement, and brain-computer interfaces, with transformative impacts on healthcare, education, and human-computer interaction in the coming decade.\tIn the very long term, spanning the next century, EEG technology is poised to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reading and translating human thoughts, as well as in the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems. Imagine a future where EEG technology has evolved to the point where it can decode the intricate neural patterns associated with human thoughts and intentions with unprecedented accuracy. This could enable a direct interface between the human brain and machines, allowing individuals to communicate their thoughts and ideas to computers and robots seamlessly. Such advancements could lead to a profound transformation in human-computer interaction, as individuals may control complex tasks, devices, and even robotic entities using nothing but their thoughts.  On the flip side, this innovation also raises profound ethical and privacy concerns. The ability to read thoughts and intentions directly from EEG signals prompts discussions about consent, privacy, and the need for robust ethical frameworks to govern the use of such technology. The development of highly intelligent robots, capable of processing and responding to human thoughts, could revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare to manufacturing, but it also necessitates careful consideration of the ethical and societal implications. Striking a balance between the potential benefits of mind-machine communication and the protection of individual autonomy and privacy will be a critical challenge in the distant future of EEG technology.\tIn the future, advances in other neuroimaging technologies, such as high-resolution MRI, invasive brain-machine interfaces, miniaturized wearable devices, and improved data integration methods, may diminish the prominence of EEG in specific applications. While EEG offers valuable insights into brain activity, these emerging technologies may provide more detailed, precise, or convenient solutions for particular research and clinical needs. However, EEG&#x27;s unique advantages, including its portability and ability to capture rapid neural dynamics, will likely ensure its continued relevance, particularly in areas like brain-computer interfaces and neurofeedback. The evolving landscape of neuroimaging will likely involve a synergistic relationship between various modalities, each contributing to our understanding of the brain in different ways.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe importance of Time in brain functioning\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tActive Electrodes, Distribution of Open Source Software and Code to Process &amp; Analze EEG Data (EEGlab, ERPlab, Matlab Code in Books like &quot;Analyzing Neural Time Series Data&quot;)\t\tChallenges in high quality recording, processing, and analyzing EEG data.

The second important discovery is the notion that the different spectral components can be used to characterize different psychological states.\t\tThe biggest issue is to not take the EEG as a window on our mental life in its full spectrum. It is a powerful tool but it has different limitation because it relies on electrophysiological activity oroginating in small portions of the brain (cortical areas and mostly in sulci) ignoring most of subcortical and activity in non-pyramidal neurons. The ignorance on these limitations led to think that the characterization of alpha/beta activity could explain too much and, consequently, brain activity was oversimplified in respect to the complexity of our cognitive machinery. \tI think that the applications of techniques that explore different time frames together (like decoding of multivariate signals or microstates) together with the use of classifiers would make a great advance for research purposes. \tI expect that fully mobile EEG system with integrated electrodes to collect physiological data (muscles, respiration, heartbeat) will be lighter and more ecological. Also, analysis will take in account more variables than now allowing to control for multiple features according to each experiment. \tI can&#x27;t imagine that but I think that a more precise characterization in terms of source localization that will pair MRI will be reached in some way.

By high-quality I also mean devoid of non-brain signal (such as eye blink, muscle activity), which could be achievable through very efficient machine learning/deep learning systems, able to adapt rapidly to individual signals and correct artifacts online.  \tI think optically pumped magnetometers may in fact be an innovation capable to take over the EEG technology.

The discovery of event-related potentials (ERPs) was another important breakthrough for research and further developments in the use of EEG. ERPs reflect specific sensory, cognitive, and/or motor events. This discovery contributed immensely to the field of cognitive neuroscience.  In more applied contexts, the development of brain machine interfaces was important, with clear applications to help people with disabilities.\t\tObtaining quality data is not easy and requires training.

The use of EEG for disease diagnonis/prognosis, training through neurofeedback (if at some point is demonstatrated that it work successfully), and BCI applications are very nice efforts that if proven successfull and robust in open and experiments, could definitely accelerate the widespread use of EEG.\twireless weareble EEG with good data quality that enables brain recording during movement or naturalistic behaviour.  \twireless weareble EEG with good data quality, almost transparent to the user, liked to the pohone/watch or independent itself, for daily health monitoring, in the same way we use wearables now for cardiac, repiration, etc monitoring. EEG close-loop applications.  \tCurrently, for example voice control of devices works relatively well, whereas brain control performs poorly. When thinking about BCI, etc, maybe other ways can be similarly efficient. Maybe we don&#x27;t need to think to switch on the light when we arrive home, because, IA knows this is something we typically do, and don&#x27;t even need to think about it.  For clinical applications, I do think EEG has a real advantage, being non invasive and allowing movement, so to these aims, I see EEG becoming quite relevant. Maybe optical MEG will also be game changer, as it follows very similar approach.\tHaving such a long temporal line, might have biased my results towards loger times.

The discovery of alpha, beta, delta, and theta brain waves provided foundational insights. Advancements in signal processing enhanced EEG&#x27;s resolution, enabling more precise mapping of brain activity. The development of portable EEG devices expanded applications beyond clinical settings, influencing fields like neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces. These breakthroughs not only deepened our knowledge of the brain but also spurred innovations with potential societal impacts, from healthcare diagnostics to brain-controlled technologies.\t\tChallenges in EEG applications include limitations in spatial resolution, susceptibility to artifacts, and the need for skilled interpretation. In research, ensuring reproducibility and standardization poses a hurdle. Clinically, issues like individual variability and specificity of EEG patterns for certain disorders remain. Commercially, privacy concerns and ethical considerations surrounding brain data collection and usage are significant. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration, technological advancements, and ethical frameworks to maximize the potential benefits while mitigating risks.\tPromising developments in EEG include advancements in machine learning for data analysis, fostering more accurate and efficient interpretation. Integration with other neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, enhances spatial resolution. Miniaturization and improved wearability contribute to increased accessibility and long-term monitoring capabilities. Collaborative initiatives and open-access datasets facilitate broader research impact. These efforts parallel the transformative impact of large language models in AI, emphasizing the synergy of advanced algorithms, interdisciplinary collaboration, and accessibility in driving meaningful breakthroughs with societal implications.\tAnticipated EEG innovations in the next decade may include improved spatial resolution through advanced signal processing techniques and the integration of novel sensor technologies. Wearable EEG devices with enhanced comfort and extended monitoring capabilities are likely to become more prevalent. Innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could see EEG being employed for more sophisticated and practical applications, such as controlling external devices with greater precision. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize both research and real-world applications, enabling more accurate brain monitoring, facilitating personalized healthcare interventions, and expanding the scope of brain-controlled technologies in various fields.\tIn the very long term, EEG technology may witness transformative innovations such as enhanced brain mapping with unprecedented resolution, enabling a comprehensive understanding of neural networks. Integration with advanced computational models and artificial intelligence could lead to highly predictive and personalized brain diagnostics. Non-invasive techniques might evolve to capture deeper brain structures with precision. The potential implications include revolutionary breakthroughs in neuroscience, unraveling complex brain functions and disorders. In real-world applications, this could translate into highly targeted therapeutic interventions, personalized neurofeedback for mental health, and sophisticated brain-machine interfaces, fostering a deeper integration of brain technology into everyday life. Ethical considerations around privacy and control over brain data would become increasingly important in such a future landscape.\tWhile EEG continues to be a valuable tool, advances in neuroimaging technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and emerging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may offer complementary or superior capabilities in certain contexts. These alternatives provide improved spatial resolution, offering detailed insights into brain structures and functions. Additionally, developments in direct neural interfaces and implantable technologies might surpass EEG in capturing precise neural activity. However, the non-invasiveness, affordability, and portability of EEG may still ensure its relevance, especially in scenarios where real-time monitoring, accessibility, and comfort are priorities. The landscape will likely involve a combination of technologies catering to specific needs.\t\t11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- clinical applications - the discovery of evoked (event-related) potentials - the discovery of P300 component of ERPs - spectral (frequency) analysis of EEG - time-frequency analysis of ERPs - source localization - combined EEG-fMRI recording and analysis \t\tThis will be a matter of future research.\tI am skeptical.

It has also allowed us to study cognition in contexts where behavioural responses are not possible such as during sleep or in infants.\t\tThe first issue that comes to mind is the issue of hair texture.

Further improvement will neccessarily come from intracraneal (SEEG) recordings. The most reliable application is the use of certain features as biomarkers for pathology.    \t\tVolume conduction is the main burden. EEG fluctuations are subtractive mixtures of co-active deep sources and hence cannot be ascribed to specific populations. I personally disagree to the commercial use of EEG. Whatever the EEG can tell is private and should not be disclosed to other than health system autorized partners udner strict terms of confidentiality.   \tEEG should be interpreted in function of specific deep sources. Hence main breakthroughs will come from progress in the later field. \tScalp EEG is not likely to take any lead in research or clinical environments.

The biggest risk is the development of lie detection methods that work and, therefore, could be abused by totalitarian governments.\tMultivariate pattern analysis (decoding) is the most promising development that can be expected to lead to major breakthroughs.\tDry electrodes or room temperature SQUIDs might be developed in the next 10 years. This could lead to widespread applications, which would indirectly benefit science.\tIf global warming doesn&#x27;t end civilization and science continues, I think EEG will become subsumed under general MRI-type technology.\tCheap, video-based recordings of eye-movements, blinks, electrodermal activity, and facial muscle responses will replace or obviate some EEG techniques.\tTLDR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMajor breakthroughs (+ relevance) - Discovery of the human brain rhythms (relevant for clinical diagnosis, sleep research) - Discovery of ERPs (relevant for Cognitive Neuroscience, BCI - Development of Time-Frequency-Analysis (changing our understanding of human cognition; potentially also the generation of the ERP) - Development of mobile EEG systems (relevant for application, sleep research)  Not to forget (but not specifically EEG-related): - Development of the computer!

It enables timely interventions.  Sleep Research: EEG enables the identification of different sleep stages and patterns, enhancing our understanding of sleep disorders and their treatment.  Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): EEG-based BCIs allow individuals to control devices and communicate using their brain activity, offering hope for people with severe motor disabilities.  Neurofeedback: EEG-based neurofeedback has been used to treat conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD. Patients learn to regulate their brain activity, leading to symptom reduction and improved well-being.\t\tInterference and Artefacts: EEG signals are susceptible to interference from external sources like electrical equipment, muscle activity, and eye movements. Artefacts can distort data, making it challenging to distinguish genuine brain signals from noise.  Limited Spatial Resolution: EEG provides excellent temporal resolution but limited spatial resolution. It measures electrical activity on the scalp and cannot pinpoint the exact source of brain activity. This can hinder the precise localisation of brain functions and may lead to less accurate results in some applications.  Data Processing and Analysis: Analyzing EEG data can be complex and time-consuming. Researchers and clinicians need specialised training to interpret results accurately.  Reproducibility and Standardisation: Reproducing EEG studies and comparing results across different labs can be challenging due to variations in data acquisition and analysis protocols. Standardisation efforts are ongoing but face some hurdles. \tClosed-Loop Neurofeedback: Closed-loop neurofeedback systems are being developed, allowing real-time interaction with brain activity. These systems hold promise for treating various neurological and psychiatric conditions by providing immediate feedback for self-regulation.  Source Localization Techniques: Advanced source localization algorithms are being developed to better estimate the origin of EEG signals within the brain. These techniques can provide more accurate insights into the localization of specific brain functions.  Wearable EEG Devices: Miniaturization of EEG hardware has led to the development of portable and wearable EEG devices. These devices offer opportunities for continuous monitoring in real-world settings and enable novel applications in brain-computer interfaces and neurofeedback.  Personalized Medicine: EEG data, combined with genetic and clinical information, can lead to personalized treatment strategies. Tailoring interventions to an individual&#x27;s unique brain activity patterns holds great promise for improving treatment outcomes.  Multi-Modal Imaging: Combining EEG with other neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and fNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) can provide a more comprehensive understanding of brain activity, offering insights into both spatial and temporal dynamics.\tDry Electrodes: Traditional EEG electrodes require conductive gel or adhesive materials, which can be uncomfortable. Dry electrodes, which do not require these substances, are expected to become more prevalent. This will improve user comfort and make EEG more accessible for long-duration monitoring in real-world settings.  Miniaturization: EEG devices will continue to become smaller and more portable. This trend will support applications in telemedicine, home-based monitoring, and research in diverse environments, including field studies and developing countries.\tNeural Interface Implants: In the very long term, it&#x27;s conceivable that neural interface implants, including advanced EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), may become more integrated and accessible. These implants could allow for direct communication between the brain and external devices, potentially restoring mobility, sensory perception, and cognitive function in individuals with disabilities.  Cognitive Enhancement and Augmentation: EEG-based neurofeedback and stimulation techniques may advance to the point where individuals can enhance cognitive functions such as memory, creativity, and problem-solving in a controlled and ethical manner. This could have wide-ranging implications for education, workforce productivity, and personal development.  Telepathic Communication: Extremely advanced BCIs could potentially allow for direct brain-to-brain communication, leading to telepathic communication between individuals. This could revolutionise interpersonal communication and information exchange.\tAlternative Biomarkers: Biomarkers based on genetics, proteomics, and other molecular approaches are being explored for understanding brain function and diagnosing neurological disorders. In some cases, these biomarkers may offer more specific and accurate information than EEG alone.  Advanced Neuroimaging Techniques: As other neuroimaging methods like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) continue to advance, they may provide more comprehensive insights into brain structure and function. In some cases, these techniques may offer higher spatial resolution and better localisation of brain activity, reducing the reliance on EEG.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe use of EEG with developmental populations, allowing a window into the developing brain.\t\tUsing EEG for questions that it is unsuitable for\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot sure how this would be done prenatally?\t\t\t\t\tfMRI and fNIRS are probably better tools for this purpose\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think that spectral and time-frequency analyses have revealed important aspects of sleep that contribute to multiple aspects of cognition in waking life, including episodic memory. Other neuroscience methods do not allow for such assessments. Given the well-known age-related declines in sleep and memory, as well as declines in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, methods that allow us to covertly measure neural activity that may indicate risk of cognitive impairment are key. A beauty of EEG, especially today given new advances in wearables, is that it is portable and inexpensive. We can now obtain excellent signals from these systems while people are in their natural sleep environments. This hasn&#x27;t been possible until relatively recently. EEG is also the go-to method for brain-computer interfaces that have been used successfully for years to support communication and mobility in physically impaired populations. Coupled with new advances in machine learning, we are getting closer to developing turn-key BCI systems that might support cognition, including in the classroom or workplace. I feel confident that such developments are imminent. \t\tI suppose one risk is untrained people working in any of these settings trying to interpret EEG. It is deceptively simple when in fact noise can often seem like signal. \tI suppose AI could be used more than it already is to decode EEG patterns sensitive and specific to disease states. \tHigh fidelity wearable systems that allow data to be transmitted to research teams or clinicians in real time. Accurate measurement of neural states &quot;in the wild&quot; could have implications for understanding numerous diseases and disorders including seizure triggers, sleep disorders, and progression of dementia. \tInteresting. Honestly, it&#x27;s impossible for me to imagine given how quickly technology moves these days. Maybe EEG assessments of human interactions in space? A darker vision would be AI using EEG to measure our battery capacity when we&#x27;re feeding the robots. (I just rewatched The Matrix).  Who knows!\tGood question. I&#x27;d like to think not and honestly, it&#x27;s hard to see a good competitor of EEG.

Use of EEG with other techniques to measure the brain activity - this gives a comprehensive understanding of the process that we&#x27;re trying to understand. Example: combining EEG with eye-tracking. \t\tIn research setting, using EEG with different population (children and old-age population) and the perception to take part in EEG studies varies across places. Still, some people are not willing to participate and the non-invasive nature of EEG is still misunderstood by many.   In commercial settings, people might people that they are being vulnerable and someone is peeking into their choices and reading their thoughts (which is far from the truth)\tLike large-scale dataset, given a experimental conditions and stimuli, if one could get the corresponding EEG data that would be a major breakthrough.  Neural implants of small size EEG to collect signals from our brain and have a personalised brain measure would be an another breakthrough \tUsing Bluetooth and other techniques to communicate between two EEG channels  Availability of low cost EEG technology in low-resource environment as well \tEEG technology in education space and to monitor our brain activity in all human activities, and have a personalised dataset of an individual.

The temporal resolution of EEG makes it best-suited out of all imaging techniques to investigate this area, and the information gained from EEG research is fundamental to our understanding of sleep.   The application of EEG to understand the electrophysiological underpinnings of healthy and pathologically-altered cognition is another major area of influence for EEG. While other imaging techniques can provide a higher spatial resolution, the neural activity which underpins fundamental cognitive functions occurs at a timescale which EEG is uniquely poised to examine. While this is still a rapidly evolving field, I believe that EEG research into cognition will continue to provide invaluable information which informs our understanding of how the brain produces cognitive functions, and will direct the development of novel treatments for conditions in which cognition is impaired. \t\tAppropriate pre-processing of EEG data (i.e. cleaning) is essential to ensure removal of artifacts in the data whilst preserving the desired signal produced by fluctuations in neuronal membrane potentials. Conversely, applying inappropriate pre-processing procedures can cause significantly detrimental affects to the validity of the data obtained. While EEG can offer extremely useful information, it remains a significant limitation that decisions made by the individual completing the data pre-processing can drastically alter the final state of the data, to the point that studies which cleaned data using different methods have found statistically significant divergence in outcomes.   The training, expertise, and time required to appropriately complete EEG pre-processing is amongst the primary barriers to the use of EEG across all settings. Techniques to pre-process EEG data in a systematic, objective, and time-efficient manner will be essential to the field moving forward. \tEEG provides an extremely complex and rich data trace which is extremely well-suited for use in combination with continued developments in machine learning and computational analysis methods.   The raw EEG trace offers a wealth of information that typically includes recordings at the millisecond timescale from 64 channels, however traditional EEG analysis methods have typically involved sequentially reducing the number of dimensions in the data until a relatively simple statistical comparison can be made (e.g. averaging the activity across a selected time-period and across a region of interest so that a statistical comparison can be used to compare two groups). While this process is required in order to conduct relatively straightforward comparisons, it is likely that many important patterns and signals are lost during this process. More advanced computational techniques and machine learning approaches offer the potential to examine the EEG data without the need for such simplification of the data, and offers great promise for identifying patterns that would otherwise be missed. \t- Great advancements in portable EEG, including wearable devices that can be imbedded in clothing (e.g. for use during exercise or other activities, or for constant monitoring in neurological conditions such as epilepsy).  - Techniques for true integration of EEG with other imaging modalities to allow a wholistic image of brain activity at a given time with both high temporal and spatial resolution. \t- Integration of AI with EEG recording to allow real-time decoding of neural activity and integration with electronic devices (e.g. brain-computer interface). \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is already possible and has been used by our team for several years. I believe it will become more widely adopted within the next few years. \t\tThis is already widely used in my location\tWhether or not they are effective I believe this will regardless be quite popular in coming years. \t\t\t\tThis will largely depend on the development of EEG hardware that can be reliably setup and used in a remote setting without a trained professional.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis will be fundamental in order to achieve much of the other goals listed on this page. \tI believe there is a strong argument that we are already at the point where automatic preprocessing pipelines outperform many user-driven approaches. This will become even more true if EEG becomes more widely adopted and data cleaning is extended to individuals who are not trained EEG clinicians or researchers.  \t\t\tThere are some physical barriers (e.g. dreadlocks) that may be insurmountable. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPM MEG might start to replace EEG in some areas\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  The development of the EEG technology was highly interdisciplinary with collaborations between physiologists, physicians, and engineers  EEGs can be taken non-invasively at little discomfort to the participant /patient, providing a great avenue for brain imaging correlates and predictors for illnesses and disorders \t\tToo many variables produced and no standardized methods for variable reduction  The literature seems all over the place when it comes to clinical eeg results  It&#x27;s difficult when the physiological mechanisms of the frequency bands are not fully understood, which makes it difficult to interpret results \tOpen databases available online so that big databases can be re analyzed \tMore affordable technology to sell to the general public \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn my field, the discovery of the N400 and later the P600 are seminal moments. \t\tDifficulty with the interpretation of results from an individual participant (especially with respect to change over time, or in response to an intervention).

The lack of published information about means, effect sizes, and other descriptive statistics that are critical for meta-analysis (I had a reviewer recently tell me to take it out of a manuscript, which seems crazy to me). This is really a big one.\t\tBetter portable systems and dry-recording systems. \t\tNo, I don&#x27;t think anything else will compare to the ease with which an enormous amount of information can be gained with such sensitive timing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPsychiatry\t\t\tClinical application on neurology and psychiatry\t\tSince its discovery by Berger, EEG is a brain monitoring technique with a history of nearly 100 years (Berger, 1929). Over its long history, there have been continuous improvements not only in methodology and analysis methods, but also in hardware. In the past, only clinicians, researchers, and clinical technologists had access to and could operate electroencephalographs, but recent years have seen a particular focus on miniaturization of the hardware, with various portable devices with wireless capabilities now available directly to consumers at relatively low prices. As a result, EEG is now available for use in real-life situations by ordinary users with no specialized knowledge or experience in EEG, outside of EEG testing performed by clinicians on patients in clinical settings or scientific EEG experiments performed by basic researchers on test subjects, thus lowering the threshold for EEG measurement . In other words, EEG can now be used not only for clinical and academic purposes, but also for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications. On the other hand, these inexpensively available and easy-to-use wearable electroencephalographs and the accompanying marketing activities often unnecessarily stimulate the imagination of the average consumer who has no specialized knowledge or experience with EEG, and create excessive expectations of EEG, and the physiological limitations and limitations are often not mentioned (Niso et al., 2023).Coates McCall et al. (2019) analyzed common claims about commercial wearable electroencephalographs and concluded that little scientific evidence was provided to support their usefulness, safety, and effectiveness, and that &quot; commercialization of neurotechnology&quot;, important ethical discourses and regulatory frameworks are still lacking, and Niso et al. (2023) argue that it is the responsibility of manufacturers and distributors of these electroencephalographs, especially those who market directly to consumers and provide ready-made indicators of cognitive and emotional states they argue that they need to inform the public about the possibilities and limitations of their instruments (Niso et al., 2023). The authors&#x27; impression is that many of the wearable electroencephalographs found on the market for general users have specifications that only provide numerical or image feedback of the results of some kind of signal processing, but do not allow real-time monitoring of the waveforms during measurement. Many of these are dry electrode-based measurements, and are likely not up to the level of stable EEG measurement in terms of impedance, sampling rate, amplifier characteristics, digital resolution, noise cancellation, artifact elimination, and other technical aspects.\tThe combination of wearable EEG and deep learning.\tThe following points may be considered regarding expected innovations in EEG technology and their impact. However, these are projections, and actual developments are not certain, as they depend on a variety of factors.  Improvements in high-performance functional brain imaging technology:.  It is expected that the resolution and accuracy of EEG will improve, especially with the development of functional brain imaging techniques such as fNIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy) and EEG (electroencephalography), which are non-invasive techniques. This will enable detailed mapping and analysis of brain activity. Evolution of the brain-machine interface (BMI):.  BMI technology will improve the ability to control external devices via EEG. This could have a revolutionary impact on the development of complementary communication and motor control devices for people with physical disabilities. Improved diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders:.  Advances in EEG technology could lead to significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. For example, it will improve early diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and epilepsy, as well as monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. Versatility of brain-computer interfaces (BCI).  BCI using EEG technology will diversify and have more applications in a wide range of areas, including entertainment, education, and training. This could lead to the development of new user experiences and applications utilizing EEG. Advances in Personalized Medicine:.  EEG data will be used to develop medical approaches based on individual brain characteristics. EEG analysis could be used to optimize individualized treatment and contribute to preventive medicine. Privacy and Security Concerns:.  As EEG technology evolves, security and privacy concerns may increase when handling individual brain activity data. The need to protect personal information and secure data will need to be addressed. Ethical Issues:.  Ethical issues may emerge as EEG technology advances. For example, concerns include misuse of EEG data, violation of the right to self-determination, and discriminatory use of personal characteristics associated with brain activity. Overall, the evolution of EEG technology could have a significant impact on many areas, including medicine, communication, entertainment, and security. At the same time, ethical considerations and legal regulations will play an important role in the deployment of these technologies.\tPredicting technological advancements over a 100-year timeframe is highly speculative, and the following are speculative ideas about potential innovations in EEG (electroencephalography) technology and their implications:  1. **Nanotechnology and Brain-Machine Interfaces**:    - Miniaturization of EEG devices through nanotechnology might lead to nearly invisible, non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. These interfaces could enable seamless communication between the brain and external devices, offering new opportunities for research, medical treatments, and even enhancing human capabilities.  2. **Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Resolution**:    - Future EEG technology might offer unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This would allow researchers to understand brain function at a much finer scale, potentially revealing new insights into neurological and psychological phenomena.  3. **Advanced Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence**:    - The integration of advanced signal processing and AI algorithms could enhance the interpretation of EEG data. Researchers may develop more accurate models for brain function and behavior, leading to breakthroughs in fields like neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry.  4. **Long-term Monitoring and Early Disease Detection**:    - Future EEG systems may enable continuous, long-term monitoring of brain activity. This could lead to early detection of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or epilepsy, and more effective interventions, potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving patients&#x27; quality of life.  5. **Neurofeedback and Cognitive Enhancement**:    - Improved EEG technology could pave the way for personalized neurofeedback systems. These systems could help individuals enhance their cognitive abilities, manage stress, or improve mental well-being.  6. **Telemedicine and Global Collaboration**:    - Highly portable and easy-to-use EEG devices might facilitate telemedicine and global collaboration in brain research and healthcare. Researchers and clinicians could remotely monitor patients, share data, and collaborate on a global scale, expanding the reach of neurological care and research.  7. **Ethical and Privacy Challenges**:    - With more advanced EEG technology, concerns about privacy and ethics will intensify. Protecting sensitive brain data and addressing ethical issues related to cognitive enhancement, mind-reading, and invasive neurotechnologies will become paramount.  8. **Brain-Computer Integration in Society**:    - Over a century, EEG technology may become so advanced that brain-computer integration becomes a part of daily life, potentially transforming the way we interact with technology, communicate, and even control our environment.  It&#x27;s important to stress that these are highly speculative and visionary ideas. Technological developments depend on many factors, including scientific breakthroughs, societal acceptance, and ethical considerations. Additionally, extensive research, testing, and regulatory approval would be necessary to bring such innovations to practical use.\tWhile EEG (electroencephalography) is a valuable and versatile tool for studying brain activity, there are areas where it might become less relevant or even redundant in the future due to advances in other technologies. Some potential areas include:  1. **Advanced Brain Imaging Techniques**:    - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer higher spatial resolution compared to EEG. As these technologies advance, they may become more common in clinical and research settings, potentially reducing the need for EEG in some applications.  2. **Miniaturized and Implantable Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs)**:    - Implantable BMIs, such as neurostimulation devices and neural implants, can provide more direct and precise access to brain activity. As these technologies become more sophisticated, they may outperform EEG in applications like neuroprosthetics and neuromodulation therapies.  3. **Non-Invasive Brain Sensing Technologies**:    - Non-invasive methods, like functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), are advancing rapidly. They can provide valuable information about brain function and may replace EEG in some specific applications.  4. **Advanced Wearable and Portable Brain Monitoring Devices**:    - Miniaturized EEG devices, headsets, and wearables are already making inroads into consumer markets. These devices, coupled with advances in mobile technology and AI, could offer continuous brain monitoring, reducing the need for traditional EEG setups in certain scenarios.  5. **AI-Enhanced Cognitive Assessment**:    - Cognitive assessment tools and neuropsychological tests are increasingly being augmented with AI and machine learning algorithms. These systems can provide insights into cognitive function without the need for traditional EEG-based measurements.  6. **Emerging Technologies Beyond Brain Electrophysiology**:    - Technologies like functional ultrasound imaging, optogenetics, and other neuroimaging techniques are continuously evolving and may provide alternative methods for studying brain function and connectivity.  However, it&#x27;s essential to note that EEG still has distinct advantages, including affordability, portability, non-invasiveness, and real-time monitoring. Its role may continue to evolve as it integrates with other technologies, and it may remain relevant in many applications, especially for its ability to capture neural activity with high temporal resolution. The future will likely see a complementary relationship between EEG and other emerging technologies rather than complete redundancy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tNeurofeedback Practitioneer\t\t\t\tNIRS and PIRS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t2 Masters with BCIA and QEEG Certs\t\t\t\t\tUsing it for therapy such as z-score training and sLoreta trainng.
