<h1>#EEG100 Image Competition</h1>
<h2>$500USD Prize - Closing 29th February 2024</h2>
<p>One hundred years ago Hans Berger undertook the first recording of electrical brainactivity on a human, naming it the electroencephalogram. The discovery of this “brain script”, offered to revolutionise our understanding of mind and brain…</p>
<p>As we celebrate a century of this ground-breaking moment for the neurosciences, we invite you to submit creative visual images that provide a homage to the legacy of Berger’s discovery and/or present a glimpse into the future possibilities EEG holds.
The winning visual will be used by our EEG100 consortium throughout 2024 as part of the centenary year celebrations. The work will for example be included in a scientific commentary article and presented at various conferences (with full acknowledgment).</p>
<p>This competition is open to everyone – whether you’re a hobbyist, a professional artist/designer, or simply a neuroscientist with a creative side.
We have no specific demands on visual style or content; we’re looking for originality and creativity – surprise us! (We do however ask that you avoid designs like a brain with ‘100’ superimposed on it.)</p>
<p>Ideally the work would adapt well to various formats, from print to digital display, but we welcome all forms of submissions (image, film, animation etc)!
Please be aware that by submitting your design, you agree to release your work to the public domain under a CC license of your choice.
The winner will be determined by vote within our consortium based on originality, relevance, and overall visual impact of the submissions.
You may submit any common file format (like .jpg, .png, .pdf for images or mp4 for video) but if your design is chosen, we will ask you to supply your artwork in a production ready format.
The winning creator will be awarded a $500 USD cash prize.</p>
<p>Please email your submission to <em>century.of.eeg@gmail.com</em> with the subject title “#EEG100 Image Competition” by the end of 29th February 2024 (on the last time zone on earth).
You will receive a confirmation email upon successful submission.
Decisions will be announced by the end of March 2024.</p>
